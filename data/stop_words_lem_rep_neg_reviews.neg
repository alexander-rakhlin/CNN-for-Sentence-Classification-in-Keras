not for the very petite i love tracy reese dresses  but this one is not for the very petite  i am just under   feet tall and usually wear a  p in this brand  this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress  the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame  not a stranger to alterations  shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment  i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me  i returned this dress 
not what it looks like first of all  this is not pullover styling  there is a side zipper  i wouldn t have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me   second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath   not at all what is looks like or is described as  sadly will be returning  but i m sure i will find something to exchange it for 
huge disappointment i have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive  this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat  the sleeves are very wide  although long   as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don t need to be as wide because you wouldn t be layerng too much underneath  the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit  i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
mehh i ordered this   months ago  and it finally came off back order  a huge disappointment  the fit wasn #   t so much the issue for me  the quality of the wool is subpar  someone else mentioned a  quot felted wool quot    i guess  is that what you call it   it does literally feel like felt  super thin  itchy  doesn #   t drape very well  and feels cheap  made in china   i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid  definitely going back 
nan i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra  it s soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape  i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support  if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it  however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it  it s comfortable so that s a redeeming quality  i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though 
itchy tags   tags sewn in    small  about     long  and   huge  about     x       very itchy so i cut them out  then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy  how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags  not comfortable at all  also   i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work  i am a b cup  however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup   so for me this would only be a lounging bralette   if it wasn t so itchy 
i wanted to love this top... i really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person  it is soft and the patter is okay in person  the neckline is higher than i am used to  also  there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top  it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on  unfortunately i had to return this item   
short and boxy why do designers keep making crop tops     i can t imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top  i looked like a football player  the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like    tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work  i am between a     and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top  such a weird cut  there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so   s
zipper broke the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it  very disappointing since i love the design  i m actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it s come to that 
nan i was really hoping to like this  but it did not look the way it does on the model  at least not on me  the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser  the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back  i am      and usually wear a medium or large  i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows  it made me look bigger and was not flattering  material has a nice weave but it s thin and delicate  i bought the  holly  deep olive and the blue  colors
huge really cute piece  but it s huge  i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering  returning 
nan i usually wear a medium and bought a small  it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering  i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent  my daughter saw me try it on and said  that s a piece of tablecloth   it s going back 
huge i was very excited to order this top in red xs  so cute  but it was huge  shapeless and support thin  it had to go back  i should ve looked at other reviews 
not a fan the fabric felt cheap and i didn t find it to be a flattering top  for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are          
nan runs big and looked unflattering  i am petite  might work on someone taller 
poor quality this is so thin and poor quality  especially for the price  it felt like a thin pajama top  the buttons are terrible little shell buttons  this could not have been returned faster 
disappointing quality the design shape of the dress are quite flattering  flirty and feminine  but     there is no way that the dress i received is new  the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area  there is no tag    the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp  stiff or new  i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received  undoubtedly this one is going back   dear retailer   please make sure that you do not send pre owend clothing articles to
awkward fitting first  the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer  i really wanted to like this top  but the fitting is so awkward for me  i typically where a   xs  and sized up in the shirt to a size    it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest  size    a   i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow  need a strapless bra  and made it look unflattering overall  had to return this one back to the store 
scratchy, uncomfortable top the title says it all    this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design  the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials  shoulder is a knit  sweater like navy fabric  is interesting  however  that is where the positive comments end on this one  the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable  i cannot imagine wanting to wear it  it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric   the stiff fabric of the bo
not for me the colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess  it was overall too large  the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish  the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly  had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining  i would have liked it better  the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out  #returned
not as pictured. online  this looks like a great sweater  i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured  in fact  i m pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer  unfortunately  this sweater will not work for me  as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look    pounds heavier 
fits strange, flimsy material i was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture  but i had wishful thinking  i should have gone with my gut  this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases  it is see through and flimsy  the bottom is just like the picture  it hangs in an odd rumpled way  the top is very flattering though  so it s a shame  if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
nice but too thin i was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it s going back because the knit is just too thin  i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it s not  and because it s so light  the swing effect doesn t really come off  nothing special 
nan love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected  it is soft to the skin and flattering  however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders 
not as pictured! the skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it  and was mostly white  yellow and some red  the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me  the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return 
very small bought a large  could barely pull up over my butt  runs extremely small  it s cute but if your not a stick figure  this is not the suit for you 
light & large the shirt is absolutely cute looking  but that s just that    looks  i m      size     wears m to l top  i tried on the medium in the store  it was rather flowing  i liked it  but i didn t like how it fit on the underarm area  it hung very low  so i ordered a petite m  still the same  plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn t realize how see through the shirt was too  had to return it 
not what i expected i have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color  these are less flattering and i may not keep them 
loved this, then washed it twice and it fell apart i loved this dress from the moment i tried it on  so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent  soft fabric  and for a white lightly striped dress  not sheer  i m bummed because after washing only twice  followed the instructions to wash  on gentle cycle and low tumble dry  holes started appearing everywhere  both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest  in the white part of the fabric only  it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget
nan like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy  it must be pinned in the picture online  it s very frustrating when they do that  thank goodness i didn t pay for shipping  for reference  i m     and     pounds and bought the xxs  it s going back for sure  i m trying to lose baby weight  not trying to look pregnant 
not much structure, boxy... i wanted to love this sweatshirt  but alas  it is going back  upon opening and unfolding  the first thing i noticed  the dots and not solid  they are sort of distressed looking  with parts of them missing  secondly  it doesn t have a lot of structure  it s soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way  it s just not flattering on me  it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house  for reference  i ordered the    and i m usually a       in tops 
disappointing! like another reviewer mentioned  this shirt is way too short  i m only       xs  and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model  also  the quality isn t great as it s very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front  it s a shame b c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique  sadly  it s going back 
not a good fit this top was way too short  i m only      and way too wide  the cut of this top was so wide  it looked like a tent on me  i really wanted to love this top because the material and style  sleeves  ruffle  are beautiful  unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut  i ve have several blouses made by one fine day  which fit nicely  for some reason this top did not  i ordered in my usual s size  even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong 
so disappointed! please fix it! this blouse is so beautiful   the collar  sleeves  material   everything except the cut  it was like a tent  it needed to be more tapered  which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow  and be about two inches longer     i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed  please fix it and then i will buy again  i am          lbs and busty   a small was perfect  with the exception of the massive amount of material 
sweater not a coat not a coat by any means  merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining    and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on  the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn t pretty enough for a spring coat  sizing is also   sizes larger than anticipated 
could have been cute... the fabric was nothing special  i usually like a cotton silk blend woven fabric  but this was stiff feeling  and the pattern was cute  but what made me return it was the fact that    the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint  literally  puffy  paint  and    the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived  parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it  i could barely unfold it   i m sure this could have been cute  but who wants a top that looks lik
nan i love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite  unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there  returned 
poorly executed this skirt is very short  i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle  that s quite off because i m only   feet tall  and i wore it pretty low on the hips  it also flares out awkwardly below the knee  there are   vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem  i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my   year old cut up a skirt  plus  the fabric  while thick and beautiful and stretchy  has a
bad quality. i don t normally review my purchases  but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made  i couldn t help myself but to post a review  the neck line isn t even hemmed down so it flaps up  the material is thin and feel cheap  this dress isnt even worth     in my opinion  i was expecting a well made  good quality dress for the high price tag 
nan i got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints  the quality is excellent  this top runs very large  as in three     sizes too large  for the record i am a          and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i m pregnant with twins  also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general  i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn t wor
flimsy i love byron lars dresses  and this design is on point  the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty  and the dress fits like a dream  however    the fabric    i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel  this is  sadly  going back today 
looks fine if you don't move your arms. three strikes and retailer is out for me  i am so disappointed  i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun  distinctive new shift dress  got it  tried it on  took it off  went back to look at the listing online   nowhere does it mention that it has a drop seam in the shoulders  i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image  but it s not mentioned in the text  who on god s green earth actually looks good with a drop shoulder   it hits every woman under       right in the middl
poor quality i bought this in the white  size m     lbs           b  because i wanted a baggy fit  which i got  so this is tts  the white is more of an off white rather than a bright white  which i like because i happen to be looking for an off white tee  and the shape is good  even in a larger size  this tee nips in at the waist however  the quality of this tee is lacking  as it is the typical  cheap  marled  slightly see through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th
cute concept, fits weird the fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird  the top was fine but it became a bit tent like in the waist  the material doesn t feel great either 
itchytown is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great   yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it amp #   s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit   it amp #   s the itchiness that makes it an immediate  amp quot no amp quot   and that amp #   s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance 
cropped and itchy i m assuming the model showing the sweater is at least       it is slightly cropped on her   but it certainly doesn t look super cropped  i m      and its super cropped on me  even with high waist jeans   also  it is incredibly itchy  i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami   too bad  its a cute design  just needs some tweaking 
weird color and fit color is not like photo and fit doesn t work if you re busty
nan i loved this dress when i saw it  however the fit was way off  i am          lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down  when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect  unfortunately the waist hit way too high  above my rib cage and the dress was too short  it was as if it was a petite size  i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty  easy dress to just throw on for school  unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both  the material is also not the s
nan this top runs super small in the upper arms  shoulder area  could not even stretch out my arms     other then that major problem  the length and body fit were perfect   i am true med and or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes        and neither worked for me due to arm shoulder fit   disappointed because it really is a beautiful top   
fit is not cute i was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling  unfortunately  it just didn t work out  i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front  the top was also boxy and didn t sit right  it just wasn t flattering  cute top on the hanger  but just not on me 
do not like the front the back of this t shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird  the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft  so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy  i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front  it fits true to size 
awkward style fits very strange  odd cut  does not look well on 
wanted to love, but sadly will return. these run very small   they are also short  almost like a crop pant  the fit was so weird that i won t even exchange for a bigger size 
no shape it looks like you are wearing cargo shorts  really unflattering  avoid buying this skirt
boxy and short this top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy  looked like a tent on me  this one went back the same day it came 
nan i love the fit of these pants    they re the perfect slim black pants  however  i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one  but multiple places  disappointed by the workmanship quality of the product  especially since the pants fit amazingly and don t sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do  i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product 
what a waste i waited three months for these pants  when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased  they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about  and they should have been   problem one  they bag out  i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry  regained shape then    problem two  the crotch split  in the front  i m a teacher  i sincerely hope no one noticed  i read other reviews about this problem and don t know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
not what i had hoped for... like others  i finally received my size  p black pants after months of waiting   for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer   when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones  which were also  p   and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality   i m debating ordering the regular length  but i m not sure i ll bother  based on some of the other reviews 
loungewear, not outdoor wear so i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point  and intent  at retailer  so i had hopes  i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it s honestly so thin i couldn t even see it working that well for that  it s also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model  my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti
weird fit i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger  but it s basically cut for model sized people only  it s short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it ll make the back pucker  i can t imagine this will look good on most women 
stretches out i am normally between a size   and    so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work  the   seemed pretty tight all around  so i returned the   and kept the   even though there was a little bit of room in the waist  of course the size   after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out  was bagging in the crotch area  sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees  i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
the worst i don t typically write bad reviews  but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it  i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway  my fault i know   the dress is super stiff   i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes   i m typically a     and the size small swallowed me  and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust  i ordered both sizes to try   i wouldn t recommend buying this if you are a size   or small
runs very small don t buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger  order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size  i ordered an xs and it s more like a medium or large 
huge dress the overall styling was great  and the dress is super cute  if a little thick  it s made of denim  after all   i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it  the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i d have to wear a tank top under the dress  i m returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand  the arm holes killed it for me 
stinky sweater! yikes   quite a smell off of this one  like wet hot wool   the color was beautiful  but the sweater is enormous   strange fit under the arms as well   this one went back the same day 
so very disappointed i love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online  being       i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint  however  being       also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short  it looks ridiculous  i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in    degree weather  unfortunately after waiting so long for it s arrival this is going back 
primula cocoon cardi this is huge  i understand that s the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband s size xxl  i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice    but then it started to itch  and itch and itch 
not for me the fit is not as shown on the website  will be returning 
awful if you have any sort of curves! i am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress  when i received it  it looked nothing like it does on the model  the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled  if you have anything above a c cup  the top looks completely unflattering  i looked so top heavy in this dress  definitely not worth the price  so disappointed 
armholes huge this didn t work for me  im normally a m         got this in xs  that was the correct size for me  i believe  however  the armholes were huge  husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it  but  i sent it back 
no slip and totally sheer dress i just received this in the mail today  first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer  the description says  viscose lining  so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color  second of all  it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope  the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said  i ordered a size smaller than us
ordinary for the price i was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came  the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model  overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style 
if only it looked like the photo..... this sweater was a big let down  i am      so i ordered it in a petite  it was so short that if i lifted my arms  you d see my bra   there is no way i could wear it without something under it  even with high waisted bottoms  and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic  the entire sleeve is just wide  and it continues with little increase into the cuff  it is just short and boxy  it is going back for sure 
wanted to love it - but . . . i wanted to love this  however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted  this is definitely something you must try on in the store  too risky to buy online due to weird fit 
shrinks!!! ladies this top shrinks    i am very disappointed  i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount  i did not use a dryer  i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk  it is a lot shorter and much tighter  especially in my arms  if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit 
might be great if you have a bun in the oven! again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses  i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid vacation on the amalfi coast  i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top  since i m not with child  this one s going back 
not a great design this shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips  the fit at the top is tight  i ordered a small  but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller  i am       it hits at a place that is not flattering  i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings  this is not it   also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting 
weird shape. after seeing this on anthto s facebook page i was so excited to order  i ended up going to a store and trying on  i couldn t believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it  i thought this ran quite big  and the shape was odd  lots of material in the middle  i am a mom of   young kids and didn t want people to think #  was on the way 
sent to me damaged i ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve  i am very disappointed  because i love the sweater  by the time it arrived  it was sold out in my size  now  i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged  if the sweater was not damaged  i would recommend this product 
gold thread this is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute  i am      and ordered the regular xs in black  the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace  i would have kept this if it was plain black lace  just did not like that look 
not for tall ladies this sweater is a cute design but did not work for me  i am      and this is way to short cropped and looks awkward  the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front  it s getting returned 
lokka tunic beautiful top  loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from  hanging at store or the way it was sewn 
nan i purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color  i hated the way the second one fit  i m concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked 
nan oh elevenses  i love your pants  the fabrics  the details  the length  i ve found elevenses to be classic work pants  reliable  professional  well made  these are none of those things  the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that s it appears in the picture  the red pair are thin  stretchy and cheap  both pairs have to go back  i m truly sad 
not worth the $$ i loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets  however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great  there were multiple snags along the seams  additionally  at         lbs i was swimming in the size    i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better 
huge arm holes why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn t expose half of my bra if i lift my arm      this is cute  beyond the arm hole issue  but overpriced  going back 
looks can be deceiving i wanted these culottes to work so much  the fabric is gorgeous  but the size i ordered didn t fit  i m normally a size    in pants  and i ordered a size    it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area  not what i wanted it to be  had to return them unfortunately 
so wanted to love it... ditto what the first reviewer said  unfortunately  i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos  the graphics are fantastic   still love the boats  but the top is not the same and they ve added a fabric belt to the finished dress  the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms  similar  i suspect  to what the first reviewer reported   i was also surprised by the fabric  based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
not for big girls :( quality is fantastic but i feel like a    would have barely made it s way around one leg  this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a    a lot of fabric in the legs  nice pant but not for this girl 
nan these run small  i am     and got a size     they were a tad tight on top  the waist fit but felt a little too snug  short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material  they are a dark blue animal print  i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle  they looked so silly i had to laugh  even with the     off  these are going back  not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person 
different dresses i loved the photo of this dress  upon examination of the dress  and trying it on  after receiving in the mail  the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern  the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top  the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo  turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear 
not petite inseam... i was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam    unfortunately after ordering returning several pairs  i found out that these are actually not petite jeans  please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam  they are actually    in    not    in as in the description  other than the inseam issues  they fit like typical paige denim 
size and function too big and it s not secure enough to wear for swimming 
cute, but no sale the dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling  the fabric will only get worse with wear  return  cute concept  poor fabric quality 
shorter than expected after reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs  lately all my usual l    sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear  all would have been ok if the top wasn t so darn short  for reference i m   ft tall      lb  it s weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
disappointing fit! i originally got these in a    petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag  i m usually a        and within an hour of wearing them  to retailer  actually   the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous  i ve never had jeans do this  the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd  i exchanged for a   p at her suggestion  and i just hate them  i d say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major   but the waist actually folds over a
nan very cheap looking material  looks cheap to cost      
misleading picture! the top i received was large  really long in length  pockets in the front along the seam  and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape  the id # s matched  but that s about it  returned 
not for every body type i am           lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small  these were really baggy in the thigh quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky  the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types  my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed 
large and very wide! i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite   and i am a huge fan of a k  i put tried on the sp  while it fit  it was very long  even for a petite  what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide  even a long necklace wouldn t help deter the look  on a positive side  the blue was a very nice  cool color  i am usually a small to medium in a k      in tops  and the small fit well in the arms bodice  just too much fabric for me  returning 
quality & cut my perspective is as a sewer so i m more picky perhaps  this top is poorly made  the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece  sewers do this to save     squeezing the pieces on the fabric  it looks sloppy  the cut is very full  the bottom edge measures      around  for my figure  curvey  at      and    lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity  perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings 
farm animal pullover wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic  but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling   get it off  in the fitting room  bummer 
i wanted to love this sweater, but...... this is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors  i purchased the blue motif  the problem is that the model s  are small busted  which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner  i am            pounds and a   d  i usually wear a small in antro tops  i purchased this online  and was excited upon it s arrival  when i tried it on  i was horrified  it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me  the front did not lay well  flat  at all from the chest d
paisley silk maxi dress beautiful dress but have to return  way too big   long for me  medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small 
runs big, great material but not as pictured i agree with the other reviewers that this runs big  unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back  i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn t look right  it is not as pictured as well  the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning 
great color, not so great tailoring i was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail  the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck  that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit  i ordered a size    and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped  cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides  made no sense  hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit  order up for length  down for arm length    
shrinks i loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing  it fit really well and was flattering  the only time i laundered it i hand  washed it in cold water and hung it to dry  the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places  the sleeves are now tight and way too short  the overall length shortened by at least   inches  the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open  i m very disappointed and surprised i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is 
nan this bunches up too much  and the fabric is even more see through than i expected  so even with a tank top under it  it s not a good look for work   even unbuttoned at the top  i could barely get this over my head   this one is going back 
poor quality there is no way this is worth the price  i was deeply disappointed when it arrived  the material is thin and feels cheap  i love the design  and anna sui  but this is just so overpriced 
great fabric but really bad shape if i could sew  i d take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape  after ordering a bigger size   the fabric is just as it appears online    totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it  however  this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear  it s also too small in my go to skirt size  and i order a lot at retailer   the waist and hips are small  making the skirt too short as well   but the bottom flares out ridiculously  i ordered two of
cute dress but poor design i loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly  the arm holes are entirely too big    so big that alternations couldn t fix it  maybe it s because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw 
so sad the print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see through  i mean seriously  seriously see through 
stretch out a whole size first  the good parts  these are adorable in person and  i think  the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures  the green isn t too army green  it s a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks   virtually any color   the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice  they do seem to run a little large  so i d size down if you re between sizes   and now  sadly  the bad  these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a
nan hei hei is my favorite line  i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand   i ordered these in the green and they arrived today  they fit me as if they were an xxl  i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same    obviously they are going back tomorrow   i m very disappointed  they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty 
maternity top i was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts  unfortunately  this fell short as it was huge  not only was it big  it flared at the bottom  it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump  but not what i am going for right now  if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic i m sad that i ll have to return it 
not sure what body type this suit is designed for i was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail  i m petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn t imagine anyone it would fit  the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose 
nan i have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit  so i went for this one  unfortunately  the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me  the middle where the tops meets the bottom  is squared off  not like that v that it looks like in this photo  it also makes for major side boob sagging on each side  i was very disappointed 
odd shape this was so unflattering  the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs  the green was a beautiful  vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag 
didn't try it on i opened the package and the dress is two pieces  it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over  the sweater was too short for me  as i am busty and would not work  i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn t try it on 
nan i really wanted to love this dress  i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors  and thought that the green color would be perfect  it is well made  but the fabric is lighter than expected  the biggest issues was the size  i am      and typically a size ten  i ordered the ten and it fit like a        it was huge  if you order this  i would say size down two sizes 
wide i m      and weigh     lbs  i purchased the xxs and it was super wide  and big all over  it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model  also  not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long  this would work better on a taller person  i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big  the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace up in the back is cute 
frumpy this dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog  ordered in hopes to wear in easter  i felt it was frumpy and just ok  color was pretty but overall  i didn t love it like i hoped to 
too much fabric i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent   not even remotely flattering   i thought about ordering it in an xs  however  i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric   back it goes 
wanted to love... i wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me  the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired  the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big  the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top  for reference  i am           lbs and typically a size    i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top  i think an xs would have been to
not as pictured i ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints  while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large  also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy  the actual fabric is just flat cotton  it s a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured  it s also quite shapeless on  i m returning it 
disappointing this dress was not what i had hoped  from the online pictures  i had high hopes  but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap  the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress  needless to say  it s going back 
avoid if you're curvy... didn t work on this curvy gal   sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size   major pass 
awful fit wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right  the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy  does not give any shape to the body  do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest 
cute, but not on me! i read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not  i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big  it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame  overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else  if you re tall and slender  i think this top would work 
wanted to love i bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it  then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag  in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry   it shrunk up    in the length and    in the width and now it doesn t fit at all  also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off  before i even put it in the wash  and it s covered in loose threads  the quality is just not there  i m going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on
sad sack     that s what i look like wearing this dress  a sad  sad  sack  the fabric is less than ideal  and there is no shape to speak of  i love that it has pockets but that s about it  there was just way too much fabric for a petite person  this dress has got to be good on someone  sadly that person was not me 
fits like maternity i wanted to love this  was so excited when i ordered it online  the fabric  blue and white  was beautiful  but the cut was bad  it fit me like a maternity top  and made me look like i was   months along  i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back  in the back  because it does not lay flat like that in front  it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out  returning 
i wanted to love it... i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn t for me  the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable  the fit is not quite right on me  the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt  i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not  it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me 
wanted to love it an absolutely gorgeous  but poorly fitting blouse  the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half  got it on sale and still returned it 
not as pictured it is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph  it made my   foot frame look short and wide 
not black for reference i am          lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly  the problems     this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray purple     the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt  in other words  i had a very pointy butt  also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
not the same i ve been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy  the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell  which i imagine is some kind of starch chemical to keep the denim stiff  with the first pair  after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell      they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn t return them  the  nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them  it may be they are made elsewhere now  but it s disappointing 
disappointed i m so incredibly disappointed  the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing  poor quality control 
not what i wanted i am reasonably petite  but i like sweaters very oversized and large  so i ordered this sweater in a large  i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large  the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did  because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size  the sweater ended up looking very awkward  with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short  waist length  stomach  i do
beautiful and soft, yet length is deceiving! it is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable  but the picture for this product is very deceiving  it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page  but it is considerably short  i am nearly six foot tall  but thought by this picture it would be lengthy  not at all  it is a beautiful sweater  might work better for a shorter stature 
love the way it looks, but couldn't keep it i ordered this blouse online bc i couldn t find it in my local stores once it was on sale  the fabric is so delicate  the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn  had to return it 
nan very disappointed  the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it  i ve only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing 
not what i expected huge bummer  this top is definitely a crop midi top  plus  it s cream  not white like shown in the photos  i m returning it today 
nan i was so excited to get this dress  i need it for a wedding  and i thought i had hit the jackpot  the dress arrived with a small tear  the seams are puckered and badly seen   for an almost         dress  the quality is terrible  i expect better from retailer  i m so disappointed 
unflattering it s short and wide  not a good combo for anyone who isn t stick thin 
umm what is this i wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing  the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online  once i pulled it out of the bag  my first thought was how could retailer send me a used  washed and shrunken sweater  it is nothing like the picture  it fits like a midriff top  not exaggerating  i m      ordered the m  don t waste your shipping money on this 
nan i purchased this sweater in a small   nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves  it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear  it went back i hate dolman sleeves 
very delicate cute top but started disintegrating after two washes  the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart  i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn t use the dryer  disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it 
too delicate i received this as a gift  it is a very pretty top  but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn t torn completely you could see it fraying  the sales associate said they get many returns on this item 
nan although i love the soft feel of the sweater  the zig zag design was very unflattering  also  the length is much shorter than appears in the picture  i will be returning it 
a poor quality dress for the price of this dress  i was expecting something decent  the style is cute  but nothing more  however  the type of the polyester that the dress is made of     oh my  it is a thick unpleasant material  that will cling to a body when it is hot  i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply   the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on   no need to say   it s going back asap   you should not sel
very messy t-shirt i ordered this in the  plum  color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown  that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about   inches shorter than the listed measurements  i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh   way  way too short  i am       for reference  lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point  the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself   worn ou
down with drycleaning the price is high and i have to dry clean this  no thanks 
worst purchase ever i m a big retailer buyer  and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis  this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made      it was humongous and gave me no shape  even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same  i m small but i mean come on  this would only fit a giantess   which also makes no sense because it s the petite size      do not buy  i m very upset i have to pay the       return fee since i ordered this 
not good quality the dress is just ok  i cannot imagine having paid full price for this  i got it for florida vacation  i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained     cant get it out  thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like    sending back
muumuu looks fitted on  but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on  the fabric also felt cheap 
cute shirt but really strange design this is a nice shirt  but i can t keep it  i ordered a   and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am  usually wear    petite in all pants  and i think this size was perfect  fit across the back perfectly  when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach  at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt tail in the back  i m sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
runs very small this bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off  i think if i went a size up i would be happier 
good luck getting it on! you have to be a contortionist to get this bra on  it slips over your head and i needed my  yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows  ridiculously impractical  why oh why didn t heather give it a hook and loop closure instead 
top gapes open i was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover up  the waist does not have elastic or any structure  the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open  the fabric is nice quality but i am returning 
nan saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on  i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia  i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people  too much fabric in the peplum part 
nan i ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look  but returned them because they fit weird  too tight around the too high waistline  and normally  i like a high waistline   fit ran small  and the overall quality of the fabric wasn t as nice as i was hoping for  pretty disappointed 
odd dimensions i wanted this tank to work so badly  it was a great deal and so beautiful  unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake  my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short  if you have a short torso  this would work great  if not  unfortunately  its not great   tear
i wanted to like this... i wanted to like this top so so so so badly  so badly in fact  that after the first size didn t fit  i ordered two other sizes to make sure  xl  l  m  none of them worked i really wanted to like this top  the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not    at least on me  the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing  the beaded work is very beautiful  but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
enormous!! i know this product description says oversized but that s an understatement  i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father s jacket  i don t even think an xs would have worked  i m      and about     pounds for reference  i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it s just way too big 
does not fit well but is beautiful this is such a beautiful dress   but have to return for the reasons others have noted   the chest does not fit well 
delaney pullover i ordered a small and it is enormous  i usually wear a size     it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler  also  it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the   s  i m sending it back 
too low cut gorgeous color and great price  but too low cut and because of the design  a cami s wouldn t work  disappointed
shorter & smaller than picture/ description i bought this online  this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer  when i received it     i will be returning this 
nice pants if you have super tiny calves unique print but not great execution  the pant legs are very tight  i have average sized calves and i sized up one size  the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp  when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color  too bad this didn t work out 
great quality and color but boxy and ill-fitting i wanted to love this sweater  the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm  i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves  however  after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than   minute  one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap  the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust  combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo  it must have added   lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly  yikes  this ma
pretty, but ill fitting i loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away  i purchased a s and the fit was very off  the arms were long  which i don t mind  but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering  i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it 
pirate sleeves the beadwork is gorgeous  but the sleeves are so puffy  it looks as though you re wearing shoulder pads  the fabric of the shirt isn t that fabulous either 
maternity top extremely disappointed with this top  it runs extremely large  i m          lbs    c and usually wear between a       xs s tops at retailer  i ordered a   and it looked like a maternity top on me  the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all  fabric was also a gauze like material that was not soft  unfortunately  i will be returning 
nan very cute top but runs very very big   im  ft   in tall      lbs  i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top   sadly returned the top  otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric 
nan i really wanted to love this shirt  the fit was great  and the fabric just felt beautiful  luxurious  soft and flowing  but the collar was frayed    in addition  the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship  i put it aside to return it  then this morning went to have another look at it  wanting to talk myself back into it  but i can t overlook the fact i d be ordering a new shirt that would look time worn  it may be only this
wish it looked as cute in person this cardi is cuter in the stock photos  in person  the colors are a bit more drab  stock photos also don t show quite how much of a swing shape this has  it is very soft  though  returned it 
nan the material is cheap and looks torn  not as nice as the picture 
i wanted to love them adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don t come up very high so you re limited in the length you can wear  i bought the m l based on salesperson advice and i can t imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or   bottom  these were super snug  back to the store they went 
nan nice fabric  great color  would be lovely     on someone with a straight and narrow body type  for ladies with curves  take a pass  too much like maternity wear  and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way  the straight up  is she or isn t she  kind of way 
does not fit as expected note to photographers  please don t cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn t  this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed  i m petite  way too much fabric  returned 
terrible! this skirt was horrible on me  it was loose in the waist  tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom  the material also felt cheap and clingy  i guess the fit is tts  but it s hard to tell given how strange the cut was 
omg! back is see-through!! i was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather  as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around  the back has mesh strips that are see through  there is also no lining to go with this skirt  if you go back to the  back view  picture on the website and zoom in closely  you can see the model s black underwear 
not like the photo at all i thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top  when it arrived  the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low  on me  granted i m a pear  the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way  the only thing i liked was the color  back it went 
too low and very big armholes! tried this on at my local retailer  the red color is pretty but not a  true  red  the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days  two big problems though  the top is very low cut and i could see it  opening  up to the world  and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra  this is a deal breaker for me  it can t be fixed 
lovely top that runs very large the color  design and fabric of this top  got it in the red  were just as i expected  but as the owner of several deletta brand tops  i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank  not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes  and the top just hangs on me  it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large    bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style  will try an x s
odd fit this shirt was so weird it does not fit like the photo at all  there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom where it meets the other layer  i could wear a tank camisole underneath  but it still just did not fit right  i do not have a large chest  but this was ridiculous  beyond that  the red color was just okay  even though i purchased this on sale  it was not worth the price and i returned 
just...weird i saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband  and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up  the cut is a disaster  the quality is terrible  and the dress just plain didn t work  the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly  giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non existent breast  the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi
droopy front, heavy fabric right out of the bag  this top didn t really match the one pictured here  it is the right top  though   the fabric was heavy and felt  damp     the way something feels coming out of the wash  very odd   and the fit is nothing like what s shown on the model  the  v  is not fitted or nicely wrapped  or even tacked in place     it was just two loose  droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged  i m neither  flat chested  nor  busty 
cute... if you're planning to hold it on this romper is cute  well made and true to size  but i haven t figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties  which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on  not sure what the designers were thinking here  i m returning this one 
huge i was so excited to order this dress  had the perfect red shoes to go with it  unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small  i am        lb and it was like a maternity dress  sad to send it back 
really wanted to like it, but... i really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail  if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn t do you any favors  this made my hips look soooo wide  and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off  if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better  with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together  that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips  it had to go back 
high hopes, but tiny and flimsy i am almost always an xs in bottoms  sz      but literally couldn t get the stretchy waistband  no zip or fastening  in xs up my hips  in addition  the  brocade  is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave  does not suggest quality  as others have noted  it also runs short  i m       and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle length  i ve had luck with retailer s sale section in the past  including some items that didn t always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret
sleeves too tight ordered a l and xl  the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose  the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt  both sizes had to be returned 
huge!! this dress had beautiful details  and the material was better than i expected  however  it was huge  it completed swallowed me  i am     about     pounds with quite a bit of muscle  i ordered a   p and it still looked like a sack 
not as shown i agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture  much shorter than that  and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice  the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price   
too big i ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don t agree  these are going back  i ordered a small  i m      and     pounds  i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge  i could definitely fit into an xs  but i also don t think they are very flattering and don t like the feel of the fabric  it s too bad  i love the idea of these 
disappointed cute and very soft  but the elastic wasn t sewn in right  i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess  disappointing for more expensive loungewear 
beautiful - if you're pregnant with twins. this is a gorgeous top  very well made with a classy design  it fits true to size from the lower chest up  however  at about the mid belly range  the shirt widens out and basically allows a   month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in  size xs  i was so sad  for the price  i can t justify taking it for alterations  it would have been the perfect top 
beautiful dress, fits poorly i purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer s recent     off sale  i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night  they both seemed to be just what i was looking for  i ordered a   regular and a   regular  as i am usually in between sizes  the   was definitely too small  the   fit  technically  but was very ill fitting  not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short waisted  i am only       but it fe
i'd rather pay property taxes than buy this one! disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full      they are asking  i would be a tad skewed  not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling  doesn t itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer  i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again  big loser 
very unflattering dress this dress looks lovely on the model  but it looks just awful on me  i am      and curvy  the shoulders are cut w  a weird shape  instead of a cap sleeve  it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders  it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space  the material is nice and the sequins are pretty  but the cut of the dress is unflattering 
almost. it s pretty  floaty  feminine  the photos don t do justice to the prettiness  but the photos also don t show an asymmetrical hem  i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short waisted  and i m short waisted to start with  maybe i could ve lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i ve ever worn or seen before  it s not longer on just the sides  the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the
would be great but... such a cute skirt  but impossible to get on  ordered in an xs  i have a       waist  but could barely get it past my knees to step into  if you have any hips at all  unfortunately this skirt won t work  i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small 
nan it was very pretty but it ran very big   sadly i had to return it 
flawed cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer  you can t get it on  i tried my skinny daughter tried no go 
cute skirt in theory this looked like such a cute  casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said  it runs small  i m usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on  i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips  however once on  i couldn t figure out how i d wear this  i wouldn t pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn t seem like a good idea either  between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
can't get it on i thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on  it got stuck at my hips  i m a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts  i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible  its going back  now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me  wish i had read them before purchasing  retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one 
would be cute if i could get it on this skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there s very little stretch  for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there s no way to get this skirt on past the hips 
small i agree with the other reviews   runs small  would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable  waistband doesn t stretch all the way around  bummer 
mission impossible what an adorable and frustrating skirt  i m not a large person    d        and i ordered my normal size small  this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips  in most retailer clothes  i m either a size   or    i have to agree with the other reviewer  there is no way to put this item on 
too bulky this sweater was huge  it hung down to my calves  it also is really bulky and scratchy  it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket  i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people  i m      and weigh    lbs  and i ordered a size s  and i was swimming in it  the fabric is very thick  i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic  it adds about   lbs to your body frame       
material material is hard to wear a bra under it
disappointed the pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny s wardrobe on the set of big love  and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman 
nan even on sale  this was just too pricey for what it is  which is a glorified tank  i liked the straps  but it hangs very wide off your chest 
weird fit i love the colors of this dress  and i waited for the sale since it isn t really good for work  i wear size   in hd all the time  but this one doesn t fit at all on the top  the bust is cut for someone really curvy  but the bottom is for someone really straight  i don t know what they were using for a model  but this has to be tried on before purchased  the material is also rough  and there is no lining to protect you from that  i love my hd dresses for style and functionality  but this one is j
good concept, poor product i loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape  i was frustrated that it didn t have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head  the fabric was stiff  and seemed to be lace over cotton  not entirely sure  i couldn t get past the feeling off the material 
poor fabric quality looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff  shaking it out did nothing almost like it was dipped in drying glue  i got this for     which is so cheap and i still returned it 
no shape this dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model  i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose  no shape whatsoever  i unfortunately had to return it  i love loose dresses but this one was way too big  loose and had no shape at all 
shrinks, shrinks, shrinks i purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions  i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes  no problem  well the reviews are correct  i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink  i am returning them this evening  i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank  it is made ve
weird fit in the bust i own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd  i usually wear a size     and i have a floreat maxi dress size   that works well  i am   c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size    the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug couldn t even get the zipper up  i will probably have to order a size    to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily  it s a shame because th
loved it, but... i fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it  seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions  who wants to dry clean a tank top  not me  sadly  too bad  style was cute and color was awesome 
very unfortunate this dress is so beautiful in person  but the quality was very upsetting  i had two buttons come off before even putting it on  i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn t wear it   
not kind to curves wanted to love this top  and could imagine lots of outfits with it  the wide shoulders made my arms shoulders look big  the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place  accentuating my belly  it did arrive very wrinkled  although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment  maybe that made the look worse  overall i felt that it made me look    lbs heavier than i am  so back it goes  i am          lbs    dddd  and the size large was the correct size 
cute top....but shrinks horribly! i bought this top and it ran huge  i had to get an extra small  well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly  like its so small now my   yr old could probably wear it  i m so sad  i really liked this top    but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable 
fabric is very stiff.... i had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric   it s very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse  will be returning it 
didn't fit well for me, awkward and dull i ordered this and hoped it would be a fun   whimsical sweater for this winter  instead  it s just strange  it didn t fit well  too short in the overall length   in the sleeves  the shades of the yarn were drab  it also didn t seem made to last  it looked like it would pill snag in a short amount of time  i returned it  i d love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future  having a unique sleeve is a cute idea 
too long great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long  more like a night shirt than a t shirt 
what happened? i purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color  the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers  i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive  but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
huge this dress will unfortunately be returned   so cute online and looks like a sack in person   runs very large  arm holes are very low   not flattering 
only suits smaller chest if you have any cleavage this dress will look awful  the ties drop pretty low   look trashy over cleavage  recommend otherwise   good fabric cool look
$200 piece of polyester a      piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model  avoid   mine went back the same day it came in the mail   
looks cheap i was excited to receive this top  it looked great online  vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves  when i tried it on  the fabric looked and felt cheap  it is not a flowy top  do not recommend it 
lovely, but flawed i bought this top on sale   very glad i did not pay full price for it  i wash everything before i wear it  when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm   i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot  but the hole will be a little trickier  as the material is kind of filmy 
pills horribly i splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it  even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear  after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well  so so disappointed  the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down 
cute top i ordered this top because it was     percent cotton and a cute design  when it arrived  i thought it was a cute  different top  uniquely designed  when i tried it on  it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering  it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice  unfortunately  it did not work for me  i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
unwearable i ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail  the floral design is nice  but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt  especially considering the price   most disappointingly  the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes  with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and  thus  could not even put the shirt on  needless to say  i will be returning it  i ordered the xs  so it is possible that larger sizes do n
nice top, awful fabric the top fits nice  but after one wear  didn t even washed it  the fabric was all fuzzy  would not recommend it 
too small, too complicated i agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such  this really does have a lot going on  i usually wear a   in skirts  and based on reviews  went up one size  it still saw way up near my chest   i think even an   would be too small  it s sooooo tiny at the waist  probably buy   sizes    and   sizes up from your own  also  the skirt flares super wide at the sides  it doesn t sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand  it s like a skirt
love the shirt, but arm holes are a bit big i love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes  i bought a size small and the length was great  the fit was great  but the arm holes were gappy and big  i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise 
too sheer i bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints  however  they are too sheer  i don t want to wear a tank top  but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer  i can also see the fabric tearing easily  it is too delicate  i sent both colors back  what a waste because the prints and colors are good  these tops are also not for busty ladies  i have a big bust  and the top part didn t cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st
pijamas or dress? the fabric is too sheer  also looks like sleepwear  just not my thing 
frumpy and clingy the fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy  it was too flimsy  the arms were too wide and overall for      this dress didn t cut the mustard  i m          the dress was long enough  just didn t flow very well 
upholstery material, dry clean only! runs small. first of all  this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture  very flattering  i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering  that being said  it runs small  i purchased a large which is my usual size  and i need another inch or two all over to make it work  part of the problem is the material  it is a very heavy  durable upholstery like material  there is absolutely no give to this  it is a very stiff material as well    more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt  the skirt c
wanted to love it....! i really wanted to love this blazer   i ve even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around   spoiler  it didn t       overall  it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together  i really love saturday sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work  will be returning instead 
not a great fit this one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way  did not like the way that it fit  returned
huge i wear med or large in most items  the medium was huge  fit like a moo moo  size down by at least two 
looks cute - but sheds! this jacket looked adorable on  it was also quite comfortable  however  it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched  sadly  this is a deal breaker for me 
nan beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments  true to size  it s not thick but it s very warm 
makes you look like a football player i was looking for a really warm  but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area  i tried on a size small  which is my usual coat size  while the coat fit  it was not flattering  for reference i am          pounds and usually wear a small xsmall in retailer tops  in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on  the front material is doubled  which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach  the shoulders are bulky and
disapppointing loved the idea of this   unfortunately  it disappointed all around  it s way too short and ran small  the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap  the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece  usually an retailer small           lbs   dd  but ordered a medium  small would not have fit in this piece   do not recommend 
nan thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat  i got a size small             felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth  very unflattering  another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom  adding to the overall bad look  i had it on for about    seconds and put it back in the bag to return  din t have to ponder about it at all 
pretty but unbalanced i didn t mind the  scratchiness  others proclaimed this garment had  but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back  looks great from the front  but uncomfortable 
sparkly sweater it hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front  the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap  i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned  did not fit well and was not good quality  very thin
nan this could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed  perhaps it could be used for a tank  i am     but do have a long torso  it did not fully cover my booty 
poor quality i bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding  first time wearing  when i tied the strap  the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress  i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up  if this is all that is holding the dress on  it should be more secure with reinforced stitching  beautiful material and comfortable 
no, just no. i wanted to love this  couldn t wait for it to arrive   unfortunately  it doesn t look anything like the picture   i usually wear a m l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large  the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way  and  it is extremely shimmery   i love velvet  but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top  sadly  it is going back 
so disappointed i loved this coat in the picture  and couldn t wait to get it  sadly  it did not deliver in real life  i got my usual size small  and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves  and okay in front  the big problem was the back  it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape  and a lot of extra fabric  i considered trying the xs  but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable  and honestly i can t believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work  maybe i got a defectiv
not my kind of fit i wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress  i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try   the dress turned out to be too loose  i got size   after checking the measurements chart  i m          lb and usually wear s   i could practically wrap myself in this dress  besides  it looks a bit too long  well  i m not as tall as the model in the photos and i don t like wearing high heels    the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures  i like distressed and vintage style  but this
not at all as pictures this is quite an odd dress  it does wrap and is beautiful material  however  the dress does not close at all in the chest area  i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono  it will go back for sure 
too much fabric the fabric is very nice on this wrap  but it wears like a blanket 
nan matronly and unflattering  i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type 
strange fit, nice fabric and stitching i ordered this in my usual size small    b bust        around     lbs   but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn t cinch in at the waist at all  rather bubbled out a bit  the tunic  flaps  laid strangely as well  like they were too small almost  the high cut sides were indeed high cut   showing the waistband of my leggings  apparently that is a new style  as i have seen a few other tops like it around  but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on
it's a shame i wanted to love this tunic sweater  the material is so soft and a perfect weight  the color is pretty  bu the fit absolutely did not work for me  the tunic runs very small  a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small  the slits are quite high  i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back 
nan this dress had so much potential  the top was absolutely gorgeous  my issue was with the bottom half of the dress  the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all  the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out  the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger  i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead 
kinda cute, but elastic too tight around the legs these felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves  i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs  an alternative would be to clip the elastic  but ultimately decided to return 
disappointing quality i ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour  at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole  i called customer service and they sent me a  nd pair  same thing happened  i never even pulled on the belt loop  they are just so flimsy  it s a shame bc they are cool looking 
do not buy this dress i should have heeded the previous reviewer s advice  but i m really short so i thought i d give it a try  there is something really wrong with the bust  first  it s about     inches higher than it should be  the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust  even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves  from the side it looked hideous  too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous 
not as it seems.. i m always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone  this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it s actually very flowing  i wanted more of a straight cut  doesn t work very well on my body  i m          lbs      d  it s going back 
three strikes i am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason  the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it  i can t imagine how they got it to fit this model so well  i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves  so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue  unfortunately  i had the same problem  i am a c  cup size  perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust  i ordered t
the white dress is extremely see-through i ordered the white  denim  online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was  i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it  the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering  but too sheer for me to wear outside the house 
will pass on these these look much cuter in the picture than in person  i found them to be very thin and cheap looking  i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store 
not flattering on anyone disappointed  the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant  even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs 
not a rich style... the fabric and its texture didn t meet my expectations unfortunately  there were too much fray and cast off of edge yarns of a fabric      however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears 
could have been great! i wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn t the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big 
nope i was so excited for this dress   but sadly it did not meet expectations  the gauze fabric already had several snags pullers in it  the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere  i m       i normally take a       and ordered this in a l   it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top  also  i like to have the first button open  but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey  it s definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding
short waist i loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my      frame  wish it came in a tall size 
color run i love the way these shorts fit and look  very comfy  but after laundering one time  the lavender color became blotchy  used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas   they are unwearable  i have several colors  but the only color that was a problem is the lavender      for one wear was a waste  i hate to leave negative feedback  but be careful with laundering 
whoa vanity sizing! i was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews  i m a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions  i sized down from my normal size     to a     and was swimming in these pants  i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work  i m not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants 
do not buy it!!! this pants the worst short that i ever had    i bought  this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color    i was really shock definetly will return it to store   fyi  i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry 
love and disappointment! these are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color  sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable  this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i ll be returning this pair  i ll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used  maybe i ll try another color 
burlap maternity dress? no  this is one of the most unflattering things i ve ever put on my body  i m a very well proportioned hourglass   i tend to wear a small despite a booty and   d chest   this made me look huge  don t do it 
my heart broke a little when i received this skirt this skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i ve ever ordered from retailer  it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving  it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all  there are also weird stitching lines  one more thing that i didn t like about the skirt was that it s a cream ish color  not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt  it s going back 
too sheer the dress is beautiful on the model  in person it s sheer  but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great  i am      and the petite was too short and the regular too long  both are very boxy and seem to run big  even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect  i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size 
not good i loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little  ummmmm  no  it s weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model  i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay  i m only a   b  weigh     pounds       and it made me look huge and awkward  this is going back 
doesn't wash well :( i purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style  it fit great the first time i wore it  i washed it once  according to the care instructions  after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined  it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches  i m pretty bummed about it because it was cute 
disappointing i love sundry and their fun designs  i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey  it is just not what i expected from the picture  i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body 
too much fabric this blouse has too much drapey fabric and it s just not flattering   in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short  but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit   sending back 
off or on the shoulder.... the top is nice  good quality  etc     but how do you keep the  off the shoulder  off the shoulder  mine keeps inching up until it s just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline 
no!! i thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style  but i returned it immediately  it runs so large  the colors are faded  and the trim of the shirt curl over  so it looks cheap and frumpy  i do not recommend this  it hits in all the wrong places 
not what it seems so you re thinking this is a red and black skirt right  nope  it s an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex  spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line  it s really god awful 
don't do it i wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing  this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black  the lace on mine is actually purple   at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath   but nope   pull the netting away and it is purple  lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship  i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large  will return 
so tent-like and unflattering! looks great on the model  but in actuality there is way too much fabric  what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent  or a maternity top on a petite woman   it didn t matter which size  they all fit me disastrously  i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in  but there s too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut alteration on the side seams  sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns  and if they pin the shirts back on the models  if you put a
beware - not enough bottom coverage! such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold over design  but beware   there is not enough bottom coverage  i should ve looked more closely at the photo   it s pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage  a couple more inches of fabric would ve really helped  i m used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with  i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad  i felt like if i bent
sloppy looking the color is darker than shown  i ordered the denim looking one   the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color  it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your       and pear shaped like me  it s a no go  took it back to my local store 
eh... this skirt looks lays exactly like the photo  i bought a size small and i usually wear a size    it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt  the material reminded me of felt wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs  but stiffer   not a fan    i was underwhelmed   it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out  definitely not worth the price  for me anyways   good luck 
not attractive i bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model  and from the reviews  i found it to be super big  and unflattering to say the least  i m          lbs  i sent it back 
material too filmsy i am always on the hunt for a cute white t shirt but this one was a miss  it is too boxy  short  and the material is very thin for the price  i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring summer  for reference  i am     and     lbs and i ordered a small  bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store 
nan this dress fits awfully  it s not short  as pictured in photo  it hit just above my knees  it looked like sack  i would ve  also  felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck  it  potentially  may look okay on someone who is very tall  skinny  and lanky  but i have my doubts about that too 
nan very cute top  i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back  but that was just my taste  i purchased the denim print 
details beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft  but  they didn t finish the bottom hem  the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem  but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself  because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays  the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn t make sense  also  while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest  almost like a water mark  just overall bad attent
i wish they would redo the idea of this shirt is awesome  it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy  the ruffle is darling  i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications  i think a lot of people would buy it then 
great idea poor execution i love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn t so flattering on  such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee 
so boxy! i bought this shirt in a l  since i didn t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be  it is so boxy  it s like a completely different shirt  i have no idea how it looks good on anyone  unless it is simply widened the larger the size  maybe a m wouldn t be as wide and therefore as boxy  but this shirt is just a bad mess  returning 
yikes!!!!!! $58 wasted!!!!! i bought this very cute t shirt in sky  wore it once  then washed it according to the washing instuctions  machine washable dryable   this t shirt turned into a crop top      i can t wear it  it s going to goodwill  i would suggest that you air dry this shirt  if you want to take the chance that it won t shrink up several inches 
ruffled hem tee this is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it s not going to work  too boxy  too short  and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over sized child s shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine 
pretty dress, poor fit i really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn t fit in anyway  i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large  the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that s what i liked about the dress  i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top  because of chest  and then lace more tightly near the waist  it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering  beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit 
transformed into a crop top with one washing i loved this shirt until the first time i washed it  it shrunk so much it became unwearable  when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened 
average the dress is too loose and runs too big
shrunk terribly i was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store  but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash  even when following washing instructions   i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially  i m so disappointed  how can you make a shirt that can t withstand washing  
nan wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these  washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else  basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt  the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous  glad i didn t buy every color like i had planned to do 
shrunk! so disappointing  everything i ve owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time  one wash and this was ruined  shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry  completely ruined  returned it 
poor quality it s a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it s shape  very disappointed  i am going to return top 
sack like i thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model  i forget that the models are almost   feet tall  this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders  it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one  lovely material but not at all figure flattering 
loved it, but... i loved this shirt so much i bought it in   colors  however  two of them shrunk  i was very disappointed 
nan this one didn t work for me  there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole  it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug  the tie and waist seam didn t hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle  i tried other belts and it wasn t much better  the fabric and print were great  i love jumpers but this one went back 
shrinkage i loved this shirt when i got it  it fit perfectly  and was so soft  but when i washed it  following the instructions  it shrank up to well above my belly button  i m talking   inches of shrinkage  at least 
will never be the same after washing bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack  washed them according to directions and they were ruined  the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled  definitely going to try to return these 
poor quality when the top arrived and i tried it on  it was great  the length was perfect even though i am curvy  after one wash  done according to the directions   the top shrank in length considerably  i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality     i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use  i will be returning this item 
shrinks! don't buy i tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape  after hand washing in cold water and air drying  as per instructions on the tag  the shirt shrunk significantly  so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all  it also lost its shape  and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering  i won t be wearing it and am disappointed i didn t even get to wear it once 
really small this product runs either really small or is super high waisted  either way not for me 
disappointed this sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment  it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips  and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish burgundy 
frumpy did not work for me  material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn t quite work correctly  had a cheaper look to it  not the quality i d normally expect  this is going back 
nan it seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment  however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight  it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin 
boxy loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online  i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more  normal  cut  hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful 
unwearable but pretty i ordered the blue in size     it ran at least two  if not three  sizes too small compared to my other retailer         blouses  it was too small through the body  other than the peplum  the arms were tight too  the waistline and length matched the online photos  it s widening  the material they chose was also scratchy and rough  especially around the neckline  i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work  the blue color was gorgeous though  the patterned lace w
nan loved the look  fit and styling of this turtleneck  but dry clean only  you have to be kidding 
dry clean only for casual top. no way! this is the  nd time i ve purchased a dolan top and returned it b c it was dry clean only  both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans  running errands  etc  i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt  it is made out of rayon  and that s the problem i think   i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color  hangs nicely  doesn t cling  the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that    i just pushed them up  as a turtleneck  it was a bit l
sadly disappointed i wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost    there was way too much stretch in them  i am always a size    and i couldn t wear these  they were way too tight  they went back the next day  i will say  it could be my body type  i m a runner so my legs are muscular  if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you  i loved the color  dark blue 
nan didn t like at all  itchy fabric  looked good on model but on on busty girl 
nan the colors are so much brighter than pictured  although the sweater is very comfortable  i did not like the color combination  i will be returning it 
this sweater is everywhere! and not in a good way  everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind  within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting  great style  fabric and fit  although a little on the long side   but there s no way i can keep it 
i pity the fool who paid full price for these. i bought these on sale and they quickly went back  i was very disappointed after reading the reviews  i thought for sure these would be a winner  however  i was sadly mistaken  i ordered another pair of jeans  the same  from a different brand  these were way too small while my others were too large  they didn t live up to my expectation and were still rather long  even though i bought these on sale  i was not happy with the quality 
had high hopes but pattern is sewn crooked the chevron pattern on the mint seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right  mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address  unfortunately  the  nd suit i received was also  off center   that one is going back too  would have loved this otherwise  a quality check on this is definitely needed     beware 
chevron pattern off center in back i purchased this swimsuit in the mint  gorgeous color combination  i m      and weigh     lbs  i purchased a small  the fit is true to size  i love the front design  however  my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention  the chevron was off center  the design should have been centered with my back  however  it was on the right side of my back  i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective  the item was sold out on line  however  a supervisor was able to l
rise hits much lower on me i agree with the other reviewer  the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea  but bad in execution  they look and feel odd when on             these fit tts  and they are soft with decent stretch  but the rise is much lower on me than other      rise jeans i have  as a    year old woman they seemed inappropriately low hanging on me             as an aside  these will def  color transfer   there is a whole lotta rinse on these  and they have a strange chemical smell to them  not sure if that will diss
awkward waist band super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky 
great jeans, horrible smell i love the way these jeans look and fit  but they have a chemical smell  i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them  but it doesn t seem to have helped 
terrible fit i am      and     pounds and ordered this in an xs  the sweater is enormous  the material is also scratchy and not soft at all  i m disappointed with retailer s sizing this year  i ve had to return a # of xs items because they are huge  really disappointing 
great style, poor quality i wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice  both times the zipper was defective  it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline  so i had to send it back  there isn t an retailer in my area   this is a shame because it s got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan boots for fall  i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn t seem worth it  too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice
poor quality i like the design of the dress  but the fabric makes it look cheap  for an expensive dress  i had expected better quality 
built in saddlebags beautiful fabric with soft drape  unfortunately the  captain kangaroo  pockets are awful  unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering  the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don t want added bulk  very disappointing  returned 
not for short or petite women i bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress  i m           pounds so i should ve known better and gotten a  petite  style dress  however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger    d  i figured they would help fill it out  upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality  there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn  when i put it on  it was clear that th
terrible i do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things  the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful  gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn  it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess  another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree  it looks very shabby  it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon
super scratchy this over sized sweater is light weight and scratchy  i knew it would fit big  but the neck is overly bulky  the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture  fits a little larger  on me  than on the model  i m petite so it overwhelmed me 
petite size is really short - nearly a crop top very disappointed in this top  i have a short waist  and it was still too short for me     
nan i bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week  but it s cut way too large that i felt like a football player  this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame  also  the cut is way too big  i was swimming in this 
oversized and does not drape well i was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it s going back  because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all  i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible  i m usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me 
not as expected the top was very small  i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top  arm holes and it was short  also i didn t notice if it said it was sheer   see through  in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath 
nan i wanted to love this dress  i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress  i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent  i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge 
waist runs big i was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit  i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big  if you are normally a size     i wouldn t bother with these 
watch out for dye staining your load of laundry! i read the cleaning instructions label carefully  followed them closely  and still  the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes  pi  ed me off  just after the first wash and even before wearing them  i have streaks of uneven color on the pants  bad quality material or dye is what causes this  now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes  thanks a lot retailer 
not as expected in paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size    so for this top  i ordered a small  it was huge on me  for reference  i m           lbs    a  it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture  the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out  even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i m returning this 
huge this dress is huge  also  i was super disappointed in the fabric  i thought it would be silly like a georgette  but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin  i thought it looked cheap 
big, oversized sweater the neck is so big on this sweater  i couldn t make it lay right  the shape of the sweater is odd  it is really wide on the upper torso  but tapers near your waist  it did not look as depicted on the model  the sweater is a lovely color  i liked the two tone  but overall the fit was too weird for me  material is soft and it felt really nice on  but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck 
gaping this shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
nan it s a beautiful top but not for bigger busts  ordered an xl and the top part would not button  i recommend for those with smaller busts 
barely covered my bum not a tunic unless the model pictured is      barely covered my backside and not as advertised  design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it s a good buy if     off or more 
too short i was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic  the sweater is much shorter than i thought  i wish i could return it  i bought a size large which is my normal size 
nan really well made  beautiful  sadly it is very short  not a tunic at all 
i recommend dry cleaning! this dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase  the fit is so flattering  i think this dress runs true to size i usually wear a size   in hd in paris  and that s what size i ordered  i expect i could have fit in a   but the   is comfortable  i am       but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee  i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining  however   i just laundered this dress for the first time hand wash  lay flat to dry  as recommended  and this dr
way too big/colors off finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed  i am swimming in the xs           lbs   the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics   the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc  and it s a sweater coat  for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality  i don t doubt that it will be warm  but can t justify the price  it s going back to the store 
wanted to love it ordered online  and when it came i was very excited to open it   but the photo doesn t show how incredibly wide the cut is  it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me             the embroidery is lovely  but the style doesn t work  i had a small  but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height  might work better on someone with a more petite frame  but i do caution how  voluminous  the cut
not for the high waisted i was so sad not to love this dress  it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on  there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking  so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy  i don t really think a petite would have helped   the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps  i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed  narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off  it is a t
terrible all around these pants looked worn  washed   old looking when i received them  the quality is super thin cotton as if it s been washed a million times   is about to fall apart  the workmanship is terrible  you can see loose stitching all over  the top portion is too tight   looks terrible stretched out  i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online   
unflattering the wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big  that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering  quality was excellent  denim was thick with the right amount of stretch  unfortunately they had to go back 
wanted to love... i have been looking for a nice  white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all  maybe because i am petite        but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat  who wants that  so sending it back 
not good i m not sure why this dress is getting great reviews  the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh  it was one of the worst fitting cut dresses i ve every tried on at retailer  i m          maybe you have to be   feet tall and    pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume 
yikes these run small! i m normally a size   p  i bought these in a    because i wanted a more relaxed fit  i could barely pull them up over my calves  i could get them on and button them  but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw  size up   sizes at least 
gigantic and heavy! i purchased this sweater in my usual xs  but found the silhouette to be way more tent like than pictured on the model  the knit is pretty stiff  too  so the sweater didn t lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape  also  the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece  i am fairly small  but lately i m finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs  i know i m not that tiny     maybe this wou
didn't work for me this dress overwhelmed me  i m   feet tall and the print and material just took over 
nice but sleeves are way too long i ordered this and thought it would be cute for work  but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long  i am   foot    and do not have short arms  also it is a bit short waisted for me  i do love the floral detail of the button 
nan this dress runs very large  i am     and     lbs  hourglass  curvy build  i ordered a size small and its enormous on me  the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all  it s like a big wool sack  i d have to gain    lbs for this dress to come close to fitting  i m very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes  including petite   i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available   the dress lo
no thanks i tried this dress on in store  i loved it online  but in person    not so much  it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume  the fabric was bad  really bad   the mustard color was beautiful     boo
beautiful dress, but ill-fitting i wanted so much to love this dress  but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it  the color of the dress  green  was lovely  and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much  i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large  but even at that size the dress was too large  especially around the hips  which  for someone with an hourglass figure  is saying a lot    the extra fabric around the hips belled out some  making
disappointed purchase material is too thin and quality is poor
not great looks much nicer in the photo  i expected a much higher quality fabric  this fabric truly felt cheap  i expected a nicer dress for the price  the fit was unflattering on me  sent it back
dress is extremely pear-shaped. i bought this dress in an xs  and am           lbs  and fairly proportional  the shoulders were snug  but the hips  and maybe waist were at least    x too big  comically so   the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side 
see through i would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker  it s really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress  you can t wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don t understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house 
poor quality recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality  the fabric was very thin  easily stretched out of shape  price is ridiculous for this item 
disappointing quality i was so disappointed with the quality of this dress  especially because it looks so beautiful on the model  the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash  it s already developing a tiny hole and pilling  also  it is definitely not a  day dress   i wore it as a swim coverup  but it is much too thin and pajama like to be worn as an actual dress  the color is much different in person  the blue is brighter and  for lack of a better way to describe it  cheap looking  the white banding around the t
so wanted to love..... i saw this top online and ordered immediately   i loved the color  lace  and unique details   sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster   the lace is stiff and doesn t lay softly  and is very rough against your skin   the style   and i like shorter style tops  is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way         that although i am so in love with this color  i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public   it could have been fantastic  if the lace was softer  and some a
cute design, poor quality this is an adorable basic   i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear  this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash  i wash on gentle   hang dry  not worth the cost 
nan i don t know how to explain  but this dress at least for me did not look like the model  first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts  for me it didn t start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking    so definitely not for my type of body  i am normal height         athletic and curvy body  but maybe for a very tall person looks good  the material is very interesting  it s so soft 
very cute but cheaply made saw this online and went in to try on  fit great and is true to size  but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread  i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought  better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps  well  literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
nan runs very large and way too much fabric  i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger  i usually wear s m and the xs had too much fabric  may work better on someone with longer torso and taller  i am          c    lbs
poorly constructed and unflattering i ordered the taupe version of this tee  which was a medium brown with black stripes  the fabric felt itchy and rough  and was pretty sheer for not being light colored  i didn t care for the fit  which was extremely boxy and wide  from the picture  i expected an a line fit  but not a wide drop with webbed underarms  i ordered   sizes  and could have worn the smaller if i d kept this tee  it runs on the larger side  what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro
just okay i bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers  what i should have done was go down   sizes  runs huge  my husband said i looked pregnant and that s never a good look if your not  sent this back the same day 
pretty, but too loose and sacky wanted to love this dress   pretty fabric and colors  i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman  i m       ordered a s   this just looked like a nightgown on me  sorry to say it s going back 
does not have a straight line fit the fabric of this top is lovely  the fit not so  it does not fit as shown on the model  the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a  swing  top  i am      slim build  i ordered my usual size medium  shoulders and back fit perfectly  too much material around the middle  had it had a straight cut to it  as shown  i d keep it  because it doesn t it s going back 
too fussy and too big in the wrong places i tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall  i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine  whimsical top so i ordered a small online  but even then a small is still too big  and i usually wear a medium or an   in tops   maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust  the front was too short  as well  stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i m assuming sh
perfect - at first :( i loved this romper so much  the material is thin  but perfect for summer  the style is just what i was looking for  it s so so cute and fit perfectly   at first  i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition  it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit   not the look i was going for  i am so disappointed 
not as expected it was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn t live up to my expectations  i m          and got a s  it looked odd on me   a little too short on the bottom  a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price  i returned it 
beware shrinkage! i really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it   but when i washed it  according to the directions on the tag  it shrunk  a lot  the sleeves are now too tight  and it is much shorter  thinking about returning it to the store  but in any case  i cannot wear it again 
wrong mountain the design and style of shirt is quite cute    but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc  nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix  it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base 
not side zip and huge! i ordered these because of the side zipper  but they zip in front  even though the order listing and bag label called them  wine  side zip pants   they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material  what bothers me is that i was charged       to send them back  even though the product description  and the name before someone changed it on the website  were wrong 
sadly had to return i absolutely love mother jeans  but i unfortunately had to return these ones  this particular style seemed to run pretty small  too  i always size up in white jeans  and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight  i typically wear a    in mother  and ordered a    in these 
nan really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length   in the front  bottom   backside was perfect coverage   also most important this top is see through  item as pictured is not accurate 
great design the top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy   it also feels cheap to the touch   i love the idea but can t keep it for this price   i m a shorty so i d have to hem it too  sadly will return 
nan i m baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are  i ordered the petite small  and i m always a small  these are huge  i felt like i had on a large  i like the thin material and color  and i m sad that they are so large 
weird seams this would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape  it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy  too bad 
not as expected guess i should ve looked at the pictures more closely  i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can t see that the sleeves are split   and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version  it also would ve helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description  anyway  i will be returning this top because i don t like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms  looks a bit pirate like to me 
the sleeves..... i was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased   hoping to try something new  they re not attractive  the slit stays open with any movement  i don t think it would be appropriate for work   overall the fit is true to size  i otherwise liked the design  but the sleeves made this a quick return     
itchy and dull when i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned  i got the black w the white collar cuffs  i thought it was terribly itchy material  which could be remedied w a shirt underneath  but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white dirty color  maybe the other colors are better 
product has holes in the pocket area this is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area  it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area  the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves  it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what  but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it 
not for me i ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews  the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn t work for me  something about it reminded me of seinfeld s pirate shirt  i appreciate retailer s return policy  i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc 
great concept, poor execution i really like this dress shirt  it s great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year s pregnancy weight gain  i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots   unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size  this may sound weird but i ve tried on an   and a    and the ability to reach forward didn t change between the two sizes  i just returned the    and am hopeful the    i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back 
didn't fit right it is so cute in the picture but wasn t flattering on me  it also felt like i couldn t raise my arms while wearing it  i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn t for me 
had to return this top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace  it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though 
dry clean?! this is adorable but if it truly has to be dry cleaned that is deal killer
too small and too big! i ordered a size small  i am      size   and the dress was a mini on me  way shorter than on the taller model  the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high  so the dress was both too small and too big  very odd fit  the material is soft  thick  stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked  this one is going back 
not as pictured i was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip  i already had my outfits planned  when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online  firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped  i am       the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller   and the hems were several inches above my ankles  secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what s shown  although the width of the pant legs may have
cute color, but not a flattering dress i really wanted to like this dress  but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back  will be returning 
not as described i did not like the fit of this  as another reviewer stated  it is not a swing tunic  it hangs fairly straight  i don t have large hips  i m      and     lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering  i returned it immediately 
holy tightness this was not what i was expecting  at all  i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around        the large fit like a small on me  and not like a typical oversized sweater type small  but a normal fitted top small  a previous reviewer said it is long and straight  and i think that is a good description for it  i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra large #or a different cut of the
nice print, sloppy design this is another one of those darned swing tops  i can t even with this trend  this shirt has such a nice print color palette going on but it s ruined by the swing cut henley combo  it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men s night shirt smock  i don t know  it was just not at all flattering  i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut  i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes   this just made my
nan description is wrong  not a swing tunic  more long and straight  keep that in mind when buying this  if you have hips  this might not be the top for you
stitching falls apart i thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high  in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid  however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted  therefore  none of us purchased the pants     the staff at the store were very helpful
great design with cheap fabric. not worth it. really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount  it s basically     blouse fabric with design and detail work of a much more expensive blouse  the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily  if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle  sad to have to send it back 
poor quality - disappointed i am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase  i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style  both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store  i wanted to wear them every day  received lots of compliments  felt that you could dress up or down  etc  this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing  on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg  this was irr
hideous in green i ordered this dress in the green color  the dress did not look like the picture  i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance  i returned the dress 
fits like a mumu this dress looks great online with boots as shown  when it arrived and i tried it on  it fit great on my arms  wasn t too tight on my neck  but once it went down over my chest    c   the dress never came back  in  to show my feminine waist shape  it just looked like a big trash bag on me  very disappointing  similar to a mumu 
great dress but not functional i loved this dress  it runs small  i m normally a    so i had to get a    in the fitting room  the zippers got stuck a lot  i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in  finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well      i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding  my fiance and i tried in vain for    minutes to try to zip it up    and then it broke  the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go  it was awful  i co
so perfect...except that zipper i ordered online  i sized up one size  it fit perfect  so flattering and so pretty  then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck   badly     minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back  the zipper is that awful 
extremely awkward i bought this online so didn t realize that the fabric at the bottom is very  very stiff  i was expecting something silky  or at least on the softer and more moveable side  the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt  that being the case  it kind of juts out in weird places  the sweater part is very nice  but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture  the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o
80's acrylic quality my conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened  i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized  but i also loved the design and can t resist anything with mustard yellow  i was instantly disappointed when i received it  almost didn t even try it on  how can they possibly charge      for terrible itchy    s acrylic  it looks cheap  it feels cheap and it didn t even fit well  only redeeming quality  easily returnable 
nan loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding  unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else  it fit well  but was poorly made  based off other reviews  this isn t the first time this has happened with this dress  not worth the risk at all 
a little too flowy for me this is a really cute dress  just did not look flattering on me at all  i suppose i could have gone down a size  however i just did not love it  i am         #  athletic build    dd  i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress  here is what i did not like  there are pockets  which i cannot figure out the purpose  that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips  due to the shape of the dress  it bunches out  on my short frame  it made me look shorter and wider  the fabric is a lightwei
cheap this dress looks and feels cheap  the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely  the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking  overall  a pretty horrible dress  save your money 
just bad i m usually a fan of maeve  but this dress is just bad  the fabric is thin and filmy  and it stretches to sheer over your chest  the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose  it just droops in a most unfortunate way 
great dress for ladies with smaller curves i wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame  the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs  as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips  as on the model   and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward  on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but
hoped this was the dress for summer i have several maeve dresses that fit really well  this was not the case with this dress  fabric and color are great  fit was off especially in top  worst part was zipper that wouldn t move smoothly  took me a good    minutes to get it unzipped  such a bummer 
nan this dress is so cute  i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up  my mom  the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon  i wish i could have bought this dress but i can t without a working zipper  i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked  please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress 
cute dress, impossible zipper, funky sizing this dress is so cute but it s going back  the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true   you ll need to size up 
tight neck i tried a size x small on in the store and i am          lbs  i had trouble getting my head through the dress  and once i did it felt so tight at the neck  as if it was chocking me  the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no  i would not recommend this dress for those reasons 
wanted to love this... i should have listened to the previous review on line before ordering  unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off  i love uniquely shaped wraps like this  but this one didn t make the cut for me 
bummer oh  i wanted this dress to work  i bought it in green  red and the solid blue  all ran really small  i  just  fit in a     when i would normally take a   in retailer sizes       and     lbs   as with many other reviewers  i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw  it took a long  slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations  such a cute style  was really bummed it didn t work  i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot  but they wer
sleeves are a dealbreaker this is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer  the sleeves are so weird and ugly  they get really fat at the top  like a dolman sleeve  but it looks really strange because they don t flow into the rest of the top  which is very structured  it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders  this is not apparent in the model picture at all  the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri
beyond boxy i am not sure who would look good in this dress  it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone 
unflattering shape ref           #         g  i don t think this is for us shorter women  this hits you right where you don t want a vertical line to hit  it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are  the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn t even dream of making this work  i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me  glad i tried in store and didn t online order 
not great i loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it  seemed high maintenance  also  didn t love the fit  color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top 
not as expected i stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available  when it did  i was very excited  in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me  unfortunately  neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured  the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don t fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows  making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion  it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
shrunk terribly! i bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do  i loved the flowy fit of it  the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low  i washed it on cold and hung it to dry  it shrank to the point of being unwearable  the dreaded button gap   and lost its softness  i hope the store lets me return it 
see-through shorts i really wanted to love the shorts   when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn t show   even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely   this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design  pockets  and  comfortable waistline   i m returning the shorts as well 
nan i fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it   unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back  i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt  horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam  i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt 
just ok i love good  flowy blouses and like the over sized look  but this one didn t wow me  i thought the quality was just ok  it didn t flatter me  i almost liked it  but i didn t  i m glad i tried it on  because looking at the pics online i thought i d like it way more than i did  just not great 
odd cut i loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd  it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom  for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy 
beautiful - the first time you wear it. this top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag  with only a quick ironing  unfortunately  the first time i washed it  cold water  hang dry   it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy  is much shorter  and feels rougher to the touch  like another reviewer said  unfortunately  after i had purchased and washed    i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only  because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
returned i got the blue  it is very short  one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other  the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust   only flattering on small busted models 
super-delicate fabric i wore this for a few hours  and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades  the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings about of my day it gave way  and no  i didn t buy too small  and the fabric didn t pull while i was driving or reaching for anything 
shrunk i absolutely loved this top  it fit great and was easy to dress up or down  i wore it once and washed it according to the tag  cold water and flat dry  it is now   sizes too small and unwearable  extremely disgusted 
odd fit i really wanted to like this but the fit was just off  it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too  this one was just too much material  i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me  i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in  but decided in the end to return because i just didn t love it  the pink color and the fabric are nice   though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a   
wanted to love this skirt i was so curious to see this skirt  it looks just like pic  really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric  my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric  i love maxi skirts  i am   #     quot  and     lbs  it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric  i have slim hips but this made them look larger  skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness  loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much  wish it worked 
takes 20 minutes to put on this romper fit like a dream   it is gorgeous  unique  and sexy  i am rating this   stars because it took me    minutes to try it on   there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top  nobody s got time for that      i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend s   th birthday party  but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off  no thank you   i considered buying the romp
good idea, looks so cheap love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap  the quality reminds me of something you would buy for     at a market abroad  definitely disappointed with the quality for the price  will be retuning 
major design error i was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back  as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on     minutes and   broken fingernails later i got done  when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person  so back it goes  even if it had fit  i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons  why they didn t design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept
a bit big and sloppy this looks cute on the model but was way too big  loose and sloppy for me  i probably needed a petite size  i ordered a regular xs  but returned it  it is an okay black top  nothing great 
poor desgn this jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on  i had to return it because of the poor design  it was extremely hard to put on and take off  there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps  the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access  or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons  what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material  but not worth it if it s difficu
ridiculously big, unflattering over bust i was excited to get this shirt in the mail  i liked the pattern a lot  but was so disappointed when i tried it on  i am           lbs  and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point  there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt  despite the excess fabric  the shirt pulled open in the chest area  making it a complete fail  i m sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric  especially since she s small on top  ther
nan i agree with all of the reviews  the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on   the buttons are a nightmare  whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off  ridiculous  they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it  so so so disappointing
thin, shapeless i was expecting a lot more  but this was disappointing  the material is thin and the quality isn t great  it also hung loose  just too loose  as it runs very very large i returned it
fit was off i was really excited to get this dress  i initially ordered a small  i am a size    but when i tried it on  it was really tight  the bodice at the top fit strangely i had to shorten the straps quite a bit  and the dress just looked off  i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there  and the look of the dress on line was beautiful  but just didn t fit right  i did love the lace look  and would love seeing more dresses with this design 
unfortunate this jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me  i m      and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous    not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way  i m so disappointed 
unflattering as someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering  and i like swingy tops   it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust  the pattern and fabric are very pretty though 
stain on shirt i was very disappointed with my recent retailer order  i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front  i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric  sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition  very disappointing 
triangles aren't my shape so  i want to start off by saying  the quality of this shirt really was great  as was the pattern  unfortunately if you re going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model  this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom  it s not a straight fit as the picture would suggest  i m sure this works for some women but if you re muscular with an already v shape to your body  meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have
not for the busty babes! loved the material and the style  unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn t enough support despite a review i had read  as a   d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely  i am sad i won t be keeping this though  the material is heavenly   
terrible buy i wouldn t be so unhappy if these pants cost about     less  they are so cheaply constructed  one wash and they re all but guaranteed to shrink  the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer  they are also    inch inseam not      as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them 
scratchy and boxy for me  this looked better in the picture  i found the actual item more garish in person  and way too scratchy  on the outside  for my liking  hard pass for this petite 
pretty dress with problems i m         c and     lbs  i ordered the size  p and while the color and fabric is pretty  the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps  it was also very tight across my ribs  despite ordering a petite  the hem was much too long  i ended up returning it 
perfect for a tent this runs sooo big  i normally wear a large      lb           dd  but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large  the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together  i loved the pattern  color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent  lol  also  the back is slightly longer than the front  something i couldnt see from the pictures online 
size 16 cut inconsistently, too small this top was a big disappointment  i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size     neither of them fit well  but one was cut much smaller than the other  i ve had this problem with all of the numerically sized buttondown style of maeve tops  i don t understand why in size          this keeps happening  that s why i purchase two of each  usually one fits and the other doesn t  this time  unfortunately  neither worked  they both were too tight in the arms shoulders
nan gorgeous  but so big  i got eh pxs and it s like a mumu  i wiill return
huge i like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous  it s seriously unflattering  i usually between a m   a l and i got a small and it s still massive  but the slip is tiny      it looks so cute in the picture  but not good in person 
short! i m      and bough a size   regular  this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff  cute pattern  but i m returning it 
its alright i liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price  i thought it was only average 
nan this top is too short  so much so that tucking it in would be difficult  the designs are lovely  but the short length is putting this top back on the rack 
cheap, thin fabric. too bad. wanted to love this colorful romper  the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking  no way would i wear this 
very baggy, but adorable fabric pattern the skiers  cats  and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns  unfortunately  the fit was awful  i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite  the skier fabric is also see through  the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in  but it is not very long       rayon fabric is a bummer too  the shirt was snug at the bicep  but not as bad as i expected from the reviews  i sized up from an   to    
not good for girls with a big chest i was very excited about this product  when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest  when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small  i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest  also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected  the print is just as lovely in person as it is online  i don t even know if sizing up will mak
pretty design but poor quality pretty design  but when i tried it on  the fabric was thin and delicate  i don t think it would last long with much wear  too bad  if the fabric were sturdier  it d be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets 
too flowy loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was  i could have worn it   months preggo   
so disappointed i wore this bodysuit once  it had a hole under the arm when i took it off
great top-but quality an issue i love d  this top  it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes  however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body  it could not be repaired  i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it 
disappointed i love finding unique retailer pieces that don t require dry cleaning  i was excited to find this shirt  but it s not flattering  the bottom hem is a little tight  which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky  perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips  i also didn t like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person  i ll be returning this item 
cute, but "off" fit i drooled over this dress online  so couldn t pass up trying it on at my local retailer store  while i loved the unique color in person    the drape of the skirt  good quality  fully lines   i was so disappointed with the top of this dress  it s very tight  ill fitting    just plain   weird  i can t imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone  regardless of chest size  it s a shame  because otherwise  the dress is adorable 
one big flaw this dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue   there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open  it fell off the minute i tried to undo it  i can t believe these other reviewers didn t have the same problem  or  maybe they put a snap there instead  too bad 
too large and too small at the same time i was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read   and now i know better  the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos  the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body  the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso  the body the opposite   too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure   no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit  open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette  buttoned  it sprea
i can't believe that this has so many good reviews i love the color of this dress  it is not flattering  even though it should be  the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky  the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren t  so not flattering  it s just odd  and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape  it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly 
nan what a let down  the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured  based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand knitted sweater made of high grade yarn  wool that i could use for travel  instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater  my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom  not the quality i expected from retailer  back it goes 
not as it seems i thought this would be a cute business attire skirt  i hate to say it  but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children s book character and not retailer  the fabric made it look bulky  i sadly had to return it 
scratchy love the design of the fabric  i actually bought these in both colors  i gave only   star due stitching on the fabric  it s very scratchy 
beware of care instructions! i have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april  finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar  i checked the instructions and it says  cold water wash   so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled    looks like the popsicles are melting  i m so sad because this dress is adorable  i m buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one  should be dry clean only 
beautiful but boxy such a beautiful and unique design   i only wish it fit  it is so  so boxy   i m thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right  and i don t mean making it super tight   the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately  so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work 
nan this dress is very cute and well made  unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust  the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me  i am six feet tall with   c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you  it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric  i love the dress it just wasn t made for my tall figure 
ice cream, you scream! i was so excited to get this classic looking retailer dress  i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print  the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable  unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming  i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest  and i m only a   b  ladies  so be warned   at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big  i think if you have a swimmer s body this might work  otherwise  you ll for sure nee
short waisted, fits small i love the look of this dress on model but sadly  fit didn t work out  very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes  i m              c  reliably a size     this dress seemed at least   sizes off for me  my daughter  usually a size    could wear it except for the arm hole size  and the fact that it s     dollars and she s       going back   btw   novelty print  means  ice cream novelty   little popsicles with bites taken out   cute but more juvenile than i expected 
strange i was struggling with the options above   does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large  it is both too small and too large  which is really strange  the model makes this shirt look stunning  but the product is actually very boxy  i am        weigh     lbs and i typically order anywhere from a   p  r xxs xs  i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy  quite frankly  it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money
you cannot wash as another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed  this is extremely disappointing  i m hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back  would only dry clean this item 
cute but stretched out in minutes i thought these pants were cute  when i put them on  they fit perfectly  and were comfortable  however i wore them for about    minutes and they were a completely different size  and looked awful 
scratchy and prickly this top is really cute  but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso  i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin 
these stretch out horribly i ve never had a problem with pilcro jeans  i own several pairs  however  i ordered my regular size     i m          pounds  and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after   hour of wear stretched out horribly  they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean 
small too tight in strange ways  beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it  however it just did not fit 
what a shame this was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity  and especially at this length  unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions  if a size   can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw  sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws 
pilcro has gone so down in quality pilcro jeans used to be my favorite  in the past   months or so  i have bought   new pairs  and all have been so disappointing  first of all  the quality is horrible now  in the past  they would last for years and hold up great  my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month  also  pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way  they smell horrible despite washing  what happened  pilcro     
sleeves not like those on the model the print and front ruffle are beautiful  the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model  it s almost like the sleeves have a life of their own   so mismatched with this style of blouse  such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape 
save your money what a disappointment and for the price  it s outrageous 
nope there s a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views  it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse  the print is lovely but the fit is very odd  it s pulls at and is very tight through the bust too  i wear medium or large and ordered size large  if you re less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you  but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide  returned 
see through this white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through   i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra  it seems very flimsy and poor quality  even at the sale price  disappointed and will return   
strange cut the quality is good  as is the design idea  but  practically  it doesn t work  ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly  this top is not soft or flowy  it is stiff and very wide 
ready for clown college! this top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry  the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity  the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more      buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things 
cute jeans, terrible quality! i ve purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they ve held up great  unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be  the thighs of these jeans start pilling  yes pilling   after just a few wears  i ve never had jeans do this    whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster     don t buy these    you will be very disappointed 
huge! i am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m l was gigantic  i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well  it was not flattering because it was so boxy 
much nicer in the pictures this tank is not very flattering  there is a lot of fabric  it s very boxy    the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey  i even sized down and it s still just wide  i m returning   
nan the length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering  i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting 
baggie and big it s nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
it's cropped in the front i got this shirt in a medium  my normal retailer size and while the short fit  the front is cropped  i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back  however this was just too short in the front  my belly button was exposed  and that wasn t the look displayed on the model  unfortunately this top is going back to the store 
very boxy this shirt has absolutely no shape  look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy ness of this shirt  the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt  i even ordered the xs at     and     lbs but found it too baggy  returned 
on its way back to retailer the print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big   looks great on the model but awful on me 
could have been one of the great ones i wanted to love this sweater  the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things  but the cut is awful  mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge  the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal  too bad 
it won't fit over the chest i saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it  they had an extra large  i usually wear a large  and i thought it would perfect with some leggings  i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance  my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn t fit it past her chest either  we flipped it inside out and couldn t find a zipper  maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small  it s too bad  it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
nan great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack    so sad bc i would have loved it
high quality but too big the dress is extremely high quality  i purchased the dress in black  the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress  the dress overall is like a balloon  unless you re extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger  i ordered the small petite and am     lbs and      i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it s going back   the petite hits   inches above the knee for reference 
nan this top has a nice design  i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape  if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist  however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank  it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed  it is very sheer  even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort  plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display 
great concept poor quality even on sale sale   this tank is not worth the money  the design in the back is adorable   would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy think old man white tanks that come in a pack  completely see through and lack of shape  i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality 
wanted to love this... i saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky  very good quality and material 
not what i'd hoped i had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge  because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings  i m       so i got the m l to ensure length  maybe that was wrong  if the  laid flat width  was included maybe that would have been more helpful  but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack  the side slits  of course hidden in the photos  came up to just over my natural waist  enhancing that effect  i loved the
good idea- bad execution i loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric  i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned  totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge  maybe if you size down it would be better  xs was not available for me to try  also the lavender color is really washed out   
recommend with reservations this a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure  this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure   small waist  feminine hips 
nan this runs way big  i m a size    purchased the medium  it s just big with no shape 
really disappointed with the quality. i loved this skirt when i tried it on  the material is soft with a bit of stretch  i d say this runs a little large  for reference  i m usually a size     in retailer and the   was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out      however  my disappointment was with the buttons i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off  fine  that button is the most used  i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
underwhelmed i ve never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount  still painful but hopeful it would be worth it  i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length  and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay  while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it s not  the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks  the color is different too  it s tan and grey  not whi
nan i agree with the other reviewer  the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack  the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits  it was really a cute idea and i m sad it didn t work  i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance   i should have listened  
wanted to love it the dresss is much shorter than described  very see thru  though guess you can tell from picture  expected more for the price 
weird fit, makes you look like you're on stilts i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person  the fabric is a rough gauzy texture  the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something  they do not hang or move well on the body  also  they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off  sadly  these are going back 
scratchy material, plaid doesn't align i ordered this top in size xl  there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much  this accentuated my pear shape and was unflattering  the sizing on the top portion   sleeves was true to size      the material is so rough  scratchy   uncomfortable  they should have used a softer fabric  the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received  at       i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line  i didn t notice the mismatched sleeves of the
nan i found that this dress ran very small  i am true    ordered a    and it was snug
runs big this is a cute top but it runs pretty big  order a size down  the material is like a thick gauze almost  so i d definitely wear a tank under 
not a jacket. i didn t receive a jacket  i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it  jackets have some structure to them  for example they might nip in at the waist a bit  this cardigan doesn t do that  it hangs in a very boxy shape  the quality is great  very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don t need want another cardigan      i m           lbs and got a small  the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st
stretches out majorly loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size  boy do i regret that  these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit   not attractive  wish i could return them  but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand   if in between sizes definitely size down 
nan great hopes but a sorry disappointment  at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model  the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket  i am      and ordered xxs  garment was significantly over sized  i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit  because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo  sadly  this buttondown has to be retur
split it in the butt i love these pants  bought them in both black and burgundy  but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning  they weren t even tight  so disappointing  i will be returning them 
orange color is pretty, quality is poor i ordered the orange in size xl  the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length   the quality is bad  i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived  new in the packages  with one having a small hole  the knit is so thin  as is the base material  the arms are basically see through  it doesn t offer any warmth because of the thinness  i layered a long sleeved white tee underneath which helped  the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour  i also had two area
fyi photo of black shirt is misleading     if you look at the  th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back  this shirt is attached in not one  but two places in the back  in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached  or  knotted  in one place  and that is not the case   disappointing                    unless you want to wear this as an off the shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down  caveat  sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle
poorly made, static, and too tight.    i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit      the sleeves were way too tight  i m a size    or     and the large which would be a    had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out      i ordered both a medium  size     and a large  size       and neither hung right  the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves      very polyester with lots of static      cute idea  but not very good in pe
maternity tablecloth i had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth  and he was right  i m usually a size    so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso    but probably not  way too much fabric around the midsection  it s a shame because the fabric was really pretty  but too stiff a hand to drape well 
i feel so betrayed... i bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it  it came out of the wash  delicate cold cycle  with   small holes  i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer  it is flattering  lightweight  gorgeous color  cool raw edges  v back detail   i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top  but now it has holes after one washing so it s all for naught  do over please with better fabric qa 
love it but it's itchy! this shirt aesthetically is very pleasing  i love the overall design and colors  however  when i tried it on i was immediately itchy  the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be  in addition  though i ordered a size medium  it fit very large   almost too oversized  the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big  it s too bad  i really loved the look but i m not the type to layer  if you are  go for it  but get a size smaller than you normally would 
i looked like a linebacker when i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it  the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous  i am         #   dd with petite frame  i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide  the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly  the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality  i ordered a petite m and it was no better  i literally looked like a big marshmallow   a linebacker  the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc
great t i love this t shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a  t    it s soft  pretty and covers my wide bottom well 
frankenstein experiment gone wrong this jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality   meh  i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs  and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color  but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket  to me  it all felt more cloying than clever     the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable  since i
what's up with the tag?? i tried this shirt in the purple motif  it fit true to size  my normal small worked well  all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in  really  on a white shirt  it annoyed me so much i didn t buy the shirt 
disappointment i ve had a lot of misses from retailer lately  i ve loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale  when it arrived i literally lol  it s an ill fitting nightgown  the size small was a tent on me and it s so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn t be worn in public  there s a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn t do much  pass  ladies 
perfect....for two wears ok ladies    you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes  i bought the white one   it is super thin and lovely  but i was only able to get two wears out of it  i did wash it and it maintained it s size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry  i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer 
so surprised by the poor quality i loved the look of this sweater  but the workmanship was surprisingly poor  there were missed stitches  and loose threads throughout  and even a tag sewn to the outside  retailer was great about the return  i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed 
nan the tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo  one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing  very disappointing  i wish i had found the hole before i try them on  they are definitely going back 
cuter on the model no  no  no   i don t know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging  or what  but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down  i m       about        c  usually wear a   or   in dresses  this thing barely buttoned over my bust  and then flares out to a tent like triangular shape at the bottom  i don t think it would come out by washing and ironing it  i m afraid it was just cut poorly  i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes  unfortunately  i bought three different dresses in the
runs small i ordered these jeans twice because i love them  the first pair were mis marked by about   sizes so i re ordered  second pair still didn t fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet  
not so great the dress has a partially sewn in slip  which really didn t work for me  no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn t get the slip and dress to sit properly     i ordered a medium  and if it hadn t been for the slip  the fit would have been good  the length was as pictured  for reference i am        lbs              ddd 
shrinks in the wash even following the care label exactly  it shrunk    inches in the length and overall in the diameter  i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work inappropriate mini after the first wash 
nan too thin at bottom where lace is   couldn t sit in the dress without worrying i was  hanging out 
large & boxy i ordered the black and white pattern  which was ok  i got a small  but the shirt was very square   with a short and wide fit  i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt  sent this one back 
great patterns, too big loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white  however  the tee was way too big  it looked boxy and sloppy 
it's a tent this shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent  this shirt runs ridiculously large  purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl  no impressed with the pattern in person  looks cheap  will be returning 
good idea, poor execution i really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges  but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material  the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow  the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper  i was anticipating a thicker shirt like fabric  when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume   or a parachute  i will defin
weird shape the pattern is very adorable  unfortunately the design is flawed  sizing is great at the waist and hip  and the length is spot on  but the top is wide  it s strange because i don t think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either   will return  i m considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it 
want to love this but.... i wanted to love this dress  the cut  fit and color are adorable  unfortunately the fabric is super thin  due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti static spray your mom used to use in the   s  i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty line the whole world will see it  i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue  i am most likely going to return it  even at     off  it is over priced for the cheap
too much sweater i couldn t wait to try this on this sweater   sadly  it was too large in all ways   the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms  this was much longer on me than the model   it stopped mid thigh   the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater 
too large even in xs! i m      and     lbs   hardly super tiny and the xs was swimming on me  the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater jacket just hangs off the body  believe it when they say  oversized styling    unfortunately will have to return 
nan i loved fabric  print and back detail  design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me  even at great price i sent it back 
oddly short-waisted i found this dress to be very short waisted  much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture  it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i ve gotten from retailer  it really could have used those inches above the waist  just a strange fit overall 
wierd pattern i love this dress as far as the fit goes  it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it s cut  that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy  it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest  wasn t just me  but my store people also agreed  had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of  mostly  equal size  they looked too crazy  it s quite noticeable on  so sad  
nan boxy  short   wide  luv this brand but super disappointed with this design   
i wanted to love this i wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured  it was a thick blazer type garment  not at all what is pictured here unfortunately  also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only            love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return 
runs large runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it 
great shape, poor condition love the shape and flow of this dress  but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back   would not recommend
terrible quality of material i ordered the coral peach version in size     it ran small  especially compared to other size    or    maeve blouses i ve purchased  very tight throughout the blouse  the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived  the material was extremely cheap in quality  it wrinkled terribly  the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet  the idea of this was perfect for my style  unfortunately  the poor choice in material   poor fit made this a return for me 
not as cute in person per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium  it was still tight around the girls  and i m not that well endowed   but too big in the armholes  the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material  i kept it  because i m lazy  but not sure how much i ll wear it given the strange fit 
wanted to love this dress, but... when you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress  the stripes are diagonal  however  that is not the case with the dress in person  the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering  such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation  alas  not very flattering  so back it goes 
such a cute top i was so excited to get this top in the mail  i loved the colors  print  cut  everything  i put it on and was so disappointed  the top looks so much better on the model  i don t know if i should have gone down a size  i go between an xs and s   but it looked terrible on me  my husband took one look at me in it and said that s being returned  still disappointed
color transfers to other clothes! i really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store  it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it  in my normal size  and took it on a vacation  first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre washed  i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was  overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware 
really poor quality this shirt is purportedly made of silk  but it is extremely low quality  the material is coarse and scratchy  it s not even worth it at the extra     off sale price  returned 
cute dress, but do not wash! dry clean only. according to the label  this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned  i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label  and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered  it looks like there s a drawstring running through every seam  so disappointed in the quality and the labeling  awful  i gave it one extra star because it s cute 
test like fit this shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it  i am fairly small  usually a   or   in tops  and smaller on top  barely   b  this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy   like a pillowcase sacklike fit  there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me  it s unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders  a nice transition to fall  unfortunately
cute style, terrible material fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away  however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived  while the cut is cute  the fabric is just all wrong  i was expecting a nice  heavy knit like material  but this feels and looks really cheap   especially given the price of the dress  sadly it is going back 
sure, if you want to wear a granny nightgown... again  nope  looks chic on the model  looked like a floor length flannel nightgown on me  if you d put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand  i could double for ebenezer scrooge in  a christmas carol   i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was  shmata   yiddish for  rags   it looked like i was wearing a rag  the ruching didn t do anything to flatter my figure  the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater  felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe
not for petites here s an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term  petite  on it  too much fabric  was bulky  and ran too small  the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust  returned  
fabric looks cheap i returned this item  it was soft  very blah fabric  nothing special 
enormous.... i knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy  but this is huge   i wear a l or xl at retailer  and i got the m l and was swimming in this top   sadly  this will be going back 
tent soooo disappointed in this dress  the colors are beautiful for fall  the fabric feels luxe  the slip fits perfectly  the dress however is a hot mess  it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow y aline dress  huge everywhere  under the arms  and waist and hips  it s just an enormous tent  i am           lbs  i ordered my usual size small  i looked shapeless in this  i can t think of any body type it would flatter  potentially  women quite far along in their pregnancy 
not flattering from most angles love the color and overall design of this dress   but it s just going to have to go back  the view from the direct front and back are nice  but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant  not the look i m going for especially at this price     the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed  in the back it s all i see which is  right  on a bulls eye and the same on the front  i don t know how the designer missed this  it s the only white design on th
boxy and unflattering not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos  i have wide shoulders and am slim  and this made me look big all around  i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this  i am       and ordered a medium  also  it curls under a bit at the waist  one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through  anyway  i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning 
this top could have been so sweet! i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped    it is very pretty but once on  it fit the wrong way  i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust    the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line  sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless  the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high 
nice but nah... ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze    then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned 
too sheer! this blouse has a very cute style  the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer  there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami  it also felt slightly on the small size   almost too tight for my normal size 
traditional material in a new way love the movement of the blouse and how it falls  great quality material 
nan i wanted to love this top  perfect weight  length  and shape  unfortunately  the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right  if you are tiny on top  this will be lovely on you 
not a flattering fit the shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described  i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not  not worth the money so i returned it 
snags! such a pretty fall sweater  nice fit  wore it once out shopping and it snagged    had to return  sadly 
nice color but... the color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it  but  it was awful  i am       and the length was fine  the problem is the lack of shape which made me look          lbs heavier than i am  it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like 
yuck awful color  horribly wrinkled and just a mess   so disappointed
just doesn't fit right i wanted to love this sweater but it is a return  it is a very weird fit  very thick  rug like material and unfitted  the shoulders are bulky  the top is big and the booty is small  i am         c and typically wear a small  the arms were very long  way too long  i will say other than that the top was true to size  may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum 
completely shapeless - massive! completely oversized top  size medium was swimming on me     boxy  baggy  shapeless    what more can i say  even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo  returned 
nan this sweater is a dull off white color  it looks old fashioned  don t get 
boxy i found this piece very boxy and not very feminine  i tried to make it work but i just wasn t feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring  unfort  it wasn t for me 
terrible butt sag!!! these are horrible pants    they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops  look great at first    after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere    absolutely terrible  i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my  go to  pants  but these are not worth even the sale price  i d give them no stars if i could   this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs  if u must try them  size down and suffer through the first few  tight  hours  trust me   they will
big armholes!!! ordered this in white and the peachy color  the armholes were gaping  not well designed  i don t recommend this tee at all 
missed the mark i loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress  unfortunately  this dress missed the mark  in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white  well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink  bright baby pink  even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink  huge disappointment  my other issue is with the length of this dress  the description says that the
nan beware  there is a reason this sweater is on sale  it is not even remotely the same color as pictured  instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo  this sweater is a faded  boring  teal green  what a huge disappointment 
cute and sporty really cute suit but way too small up top  not enough coverage under arms and across bust i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on  this is the  nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned  i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk 
yuck the dress is not the beautiful color in the picture   it is a very yellowish cream  the fabric is thick and does not  hang pretty  very disappointed  had to return it 
there's a reason the model is sitting down! the dress is really frumpy standing up  something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw maw nightgown  the lace is really pretty  though
flimsy and disappointing even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money  the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design  which would be cool   which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo  so this image is rather misleading  the actual jacket is very thin  more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket  the pockets are just loosely tacked inside  for
not impressed had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits  however  that was not the case  this skirt is not lined and the material is so so  basically  for the price  i was underwhelmed and will return it 
wanted to love. i was so excited for this dress to arrive  but when it did  it was a major disappointment  there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer  also  the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way  the colors were beautiful  but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws  i am         lb and the small fit tts  will be sending it back
oh dear, no! uhm no  oh dear  no  i was initially drawn to this blouse s lovely fabric  the color and pattern are truly stunning  i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy  oh boy was i right  sadly  this is one of the least flattering tops that i ve ever tried on at retailer  it might be a great maternity top  though 
nan this shirt fits very closely to the body  it has a very strange fit in the shoulder  though  the arms themselves are really long  far past my hands  yet it s very tight in the shoulder and under arm area  for reference  i am            pounds and ordered a small  which is what i usually need 
nan poor quality  i expected much more from the material 
just a layering piece for me wow  this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body  yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves  to me  it seems like the material will wear well  i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure  it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even   lbs  it won t work  i ordered the medium and am usually a small  the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy  i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas 
husband said it looked like a straight jacket this is way cuter on the model  it runs so big that it is very unflattering  perhaps on someone tall it would look better  but sadly it looked dumpy on my     frame  it also arrived with some black stain on it  it is going back 
disappointment in the ivory version i ordered this in size xl in ivory  it was a drab  poorly made  too small sweater  the knit material wasn t good quality and the overall fit didn t work  i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems  but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available  this was returned 
nan i wanted this so badly  to wear as a dress over a slip  but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on  it made me look    pounds heavier than i am  and the fit was awful  i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me  i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big  so disappointed because it s so pretty 
cute, but not flattering on i really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn t flattering when i received my order  i ordered two sizes     and    i am      athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is  the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to      sadly  i had to return both  perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame 
nan this was so boxy and unflattering  i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag  was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit  sizing down would not help this one  went back 
nope! i ordered these a size up because i d just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size  my pre pre baby size  chubby phase  were size       these fit like a size    way too small  very disappointed 
arms too long and waist too short loved the color and the deshn  but when i put on  did not look right  waist was too short and the arms were long 
too cropped as others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren t high waisted  i m going to try it with a few dresses before i return it  the lining is adorable  so i don t want to have to send it back 
not flattering i love the color patterns and fabric   it has full lining   my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style   makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering   a straight  shift  style would have been much better   dress runs large  however the arm shoulder area is tight 
nan it is a beautiful top but runs huge    i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering  i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it  
nan based on the other reviews  i sized down from my usual  p to a  p  but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering  i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn t work  i can t imagine this would flatter very many people  the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive  very disappointed  this will be going back for sure 
loved it on the model... i want to be the person who lounges like the model   but this was huge and more wool feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for  i am an    got the xs s it was the right size    i returned it 
oversized and unstructured but soft i tried this shirt in a small  my usual retailer size  and it was very unflattering    the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made   however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag 
so blah based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed  the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won t last a season undamaged  it reminds me of a duster i bought    years ago at a discount fast fashion retailer when i was a student  sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package  collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare  the drape is not structured enough  everything about this screams over priced bath
huge letdown i never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss  first off  it s about   sizes too big  second off  it s knitted with a metallic thread that you can t really notice in the picture  i m usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient 
not as pictured the jeans look so different online  the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut  the rise is not as stated and is actually      inches  also  i m a true    and the waist is like a     but the legs are super skinny  i m so disappointed and i m not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size  these look more like men s cut jeans 
runs small and looks different in person i ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived  it didn t look quite like it does in the photos online  it also runs small  i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price 
manufacturing process incomplete only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed  meh 
hideous looking does not look like the picture  lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up  i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs 
sweater not as shown in photo much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo  when i pulled it out of the package i thought i d ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow  but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape  it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion  it doesn t look anything like the phot
runs small i love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer  however  this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering  opening to hit you right  i did really like the color   ordered the brown  and material but back it goes 
odd fit, beautiful design but poor execution i wanted to love this blouse so much  but try as i might  it just fit so oddly on me  i m usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown  first  the color was more gray brown but it was still ok  but second  the fit was off  maybe i just got a bad one  but the center of the blouse was so offset  that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v neck was so low that you could see my bra   there was no adjusting i could do to fix it  the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
nan this fell apart after wearing it once  for the price  it should hold up better  it s too delicate 
poor quality very disappointed  ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn t have worn it and the zipper was sticking  the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked  some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under      but at      they are not  returning both sizes 
nice concept. disappointing reality. a good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes  i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry  so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey  when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric  it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap 
nan this is one fabulous looking dress  however  the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal breaker for me  i even tried sizing up  to see if that would help  but it was still too scratchy for me 
less than "just okay" i was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on  i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame  it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger  i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color  ladies with hips or a booty  beware   this looked horrible on me  it clung to my butt and didn t hang nice and straight like it does in this picture  i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
pretty colors loved loved loved the shirt but   the material was so thin
not the same... i agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same  thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time  i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back  this seems to be the trend in jeans nydj also uses this fabric stretches too much 
nan i really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of  if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only  also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view 
lovely colors but huge and not as pictured i loved the colors  especially the pink  and thought this would be really pretty  however  when i received it  its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it  i also found it huge  normally  i wear an xxsp or a   p  for reference i am        e and    in waist  i tried both the xxsp  fit better but was too short  and the xxs  too large   i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted  but its definitely not 
tried to make this top work, too short i bought this in size xl  it ran much shorter   smaller than is typical for this brand  i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model s photos  the lace itself was pretty  intricate and washed well  i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times  the cropped length and close fit just didn t work on me  i thought the sleeve shape was pretty  with just a little more material  this would have been a favorite  i hope it works well on whoever receives i
huge disappointment these pants look beautiful when you first see them  it goes downhill from there  the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants  it felt fine when pulled up  but it is a struggle  i could get past that  but when i looked in the mirror  i could see right through them  no lining and not very thick material for this price    a real bummer  especially since it was a birthday gift 
disappointing this dress has beautiful lines  i loved the design on the material  but the fabric looked very cheap   even was already snagged when it arrived  unfortunately  i must return it 
nan i really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on  the arms are so tight  i ordered in a m  which is my normal retailer size  but couldn t move my arms  took it back  was going to try in a l  but store didn t have any  for the price  i need to be able to move my arms 
not what i hoped for the color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft  but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it  i wanted to love it  but it just wasn t working for me  i m      and purchased a s  it fits true to size  however it was loose around the waist and just wasn t complimentary on me  this will have to go back 
completely see-through! this dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it s not flattering at all  and it s completely see through  completely  the material is so thin that i can t imagine it would hold up very well over time  this one is definitely going back 
odd cut/sizing as another reviewer noted  the upper portion  back  chest  shoulders  etc   fit nicely  however  the body of the dress was enormous and did  indeed  make me look much heavier throughout the middle  back to the store it goes 
plan to size way up i m a rather small person        about     lbs    a bust  i typically take a   p   p xxs  knowing how retailer s sizing is a bit all over the place  i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs  planning to return the size that was less preferred  imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on  imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy  now i realize that this is supposed to be a body skimming tee  but even as petite as i am  i coul
comfy but lacking quality i purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add on to my wardrobe  it s been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice  the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt  i m not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear  but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn t do anything that would have warranted a tear  sadly this did not serve up to its purpose  i wouldn t suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don t expec
unflattering i was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on  the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me  it was very wide bust down and made me look    lbs heavier  i m     and     lbs  ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it s tts up top 
meh this dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me     navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt  that second color made me look drab     i am      with a long torso and wear a size    in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs  i really needed the waist to be dropped further  or higher
cute on the model, too tight in person i loved the cut and style of this shirt  so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see through  if you do order it  get it in a size larger 
disappointed in the fit i ordered this dress in a xs petite  i am          lbs  the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy  the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger  i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back  it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite 
too big the shirt is very big  it would be cute as a maternity shirt 
not worth the price appears much more sleek in the photograph  in real life  this shirt looks more like a pajama top  thin  extremely casual  not worth the price i paid  even in black  will be exchanging it tomorrow 
super soft but fits boxy and fits small i wish this fit me better  i love the inside fur  it is extremely soft but it doesn t look flattering at all  it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted  it wanted it fit over my butt  or cover half  and it sits a little below my waist  unfortunately i am taking it back  great idea though 
good if you're taller i wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered  but just decided to return  it runs big and from the front it looks good  but the back just looked like a big oversized  stretched out tank  it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing  so if you re tall  go for it  
lovely on the model, but not for me i m     and ordered the small  as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return  the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see  it was way too long for me  i think it would work for a taller person  i just didn t feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency 
nan i was disappointed in this shirt  the color was not the pretty blue pictured  but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette  but not on a blonde  the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily  normally  the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses  but this one felt cheap  the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful  and i wish this shirt would have worked for me  i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it  holding horses is one of
nan white and silver threads made fabric look grey  almost dirty  fit was nice and price is great  villa to pool to restaurant would be great  colored fabric would be better 
not for me!!!! unique jacket      but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown  this will be going back 
nan i thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed  i am     and i usually wear a size small top and   dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge   i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn t expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack  i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad  i was so upset  it also has thin silver lines through it which  for me  m
not impressed i m too tall for this  back goes halfway up my back  cannot do much with it other than front tie  fabric is not soft at all  not impressed  returned it 
buyer beware! these pants were wonderful   for   seasons  yes  for almost      a pop they don t even last a full year  loved them so much  i bit the bullet   bought   pair  all   started to rip in the same spot  i tried to contact ag directly   they do not back up their products after    days  fortunately  retailer was wonderful  as always   i will buy pilcro from now on   much better product for the money 
perfect, for the first month of wear these were great pants that fit well  had good rise  perfect stretch for my curves  and i was really happy to get them on sale   i m           lbs  with a pear shape       after only three months of occasional wear  about once a week  at most   and following wash instructions perfectly  they started deteriorating  the pockets are becoming unsewn  the fabric has over stretched in little sections that bunch  and the bottom hem is coming unraveled  these are the most low quality horrible pants i ve
pretty hot mess this blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can t be saved  the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn t lay right underneath  the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse  i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print  definitely not worth the money even at     off plus      
tomorrow sweatshirt i can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away   it #   s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear   the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing   if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it #   s going back 
very itchy! a beautiful sweater and very flattering on   the stock photos do not do it justice   but  i had to give it only   stars because it was so itchy that i couldn t even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute 
a tent this is a very awkward and unflattering shirt  i am very petite     pounds and       the arms fit  length and width  but nothing else about this fit  the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath  it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs  yikes  it looks cute on the model  but not on me  the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top 
should have believed the negative reviews like most people here  i wanted this beautiful dress to fit  so  i decided to see for myself if maybe  just maybe the negative reviews were wrong  they weren t  if you have any sort of breasts at all  the top probably won t fit properly  i imagine a narrow upper torso  like a    or     possibly a    might find the top part of the dress closes properly  but with a    c  i could not get a size    to button up  the waist hit at a strange spot  and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
nan my usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small  the button popped and i had barely moved  do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust  the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work 
too thin this hoodie was too thin  you can see right through it  i returned it 
you need to be tall i m           lbs with a   f chest  this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu  i can t imagine this looking good on anyone who isn t    tall  also  the straight across  rather high neck line wasn t flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge  the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap  it wasn t see through but it had the feel of a nightgown  not a hundred dollar dress 
weird fit this dress fit so oddly  i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly  the dress wasn t tight at my hips in either size  it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out  maybe i was too short  couldn t figure it out      the color and detailing are beautiful though  a little tight in the bust 
giant arm holes i would have kept this dress if it weren t for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides  other than that  it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice  substantial material 
terrible i am very disappointed with this order  the shirt looks and feels cheap  is not flattering in any way  i am sending it back right away 
awkward maybe i shouldn t have sized up to an xl but i m not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit  the vee is quite low and i m busty  it ll be really low if you re smaller on top  the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me  not tight at all  it s almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple  i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn t recommend it 
sleeves are inaccurate i originally bought this dress in the store  however  it ended being a size too big  so  i reordered the smaller size online  although it was backordered for a month   when it arrived  i noticed the sleeves were not cinched  like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in store   i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress  the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well  this may
nan so disappointed  beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange  loose and baggy through the top and mid section but tight around the buttock and thighs 
cute top just not as long as in the picture  it hit me at my hips not good 
really wanted to love this dress as soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it  unfortunately it just didn t work for me  i tried it in a small  medium and large  for reference i m          lbs    d  the dress is really pretty in person  but i looked like a little girl in it  my daughter who is          lbs    a  also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it  the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline  however the neckline is not open like in the picture  it s more pushed toget
could not get it over my calves these socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid  i could not get these socks to go any higher than half way up my calf  i would not recommend this product  it felt very cheap and not of good quality 
too narrow these socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we re almost painful to wear all day  my thighs are pretty narrow  i m only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body  i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don t slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny   one size  is definitely not true  they also snag easily 
not worth your time and money if you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person  i bet you aren t going to be happy with it  for a phisique that is       and    lbs  this dress is not too short  however  the back key hole design is just not flattering  i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so 
looks like reconstructed old sweatshirts! i truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress   i purchased in both a sp and a mp   i am         #   the mp fit perfectly   i definitely wouldn t keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together   it s not super soft  coarse on the inside  and feels old   the back is longer than the front  it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps   even with leggings and great boots  it looks worn 
thin and blah this shirt appears nice in the pictures  it appears to have a bit of style  wrong  the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i ve ever purchased  i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style  this shirt has no style  and i thought it would  i have purchased this brand before  and thought this fabric would be similar  the other shirts were way nicer  softer  and had a different level of construction  i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w
terrible cut these look nothing like the picture  they are super high waisted   longer than they look in this picture  i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the    s that just fit terribly  i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs   they are far from it  the color was also much lighter than shown in picture  super unflattering   just not for me  they re going back   
weird fit bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me  the colors weren t as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge  not flattering and it went back  i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved  not hard to do at all
cute but poor quality this sweater jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy  i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper  unlined and uncomfortable  no thank you   should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts  i m      wear an      and the medium worked for me 
hot mess on me maybe it s my curves or the way i m only      but this was a hot mess on me  it is soooo long and cut to low for my   d chest  it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but  it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather  if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs  go for it  had to send back 
nan i wanted to love this shirt so much  i got this as a gift for christmas in the black  the first time i wore the shirt   of the buttons on the back fell off  keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together  needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back  retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem  but i wanted to give the fair warning 
looked perfect online - sad i had to return i was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend s wedding  the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc  very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height  sadly returning   might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can t find anything better before the wedding   
disappointing purchase this dress looks very beautiful on the model shown  unfortunately  when i tried it on  it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to  i also didn t care much for the waist ties on the side  an elastic waist might have been better 
love this shirt, but buttons are unstable this is a beautiful shirt  the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect   the only thing that i didn t like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are  i was taking this shirt off and one popped off  when i went to hang it  another one popped off  so i had to return it  such a shame 
nan the fabric is a little stiff  the back looks unusually long compared to the front  and it fits tight across the chest  and i m not busty so that s not a factor 
worst peplum top in history this is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on  fit perfectly as a size   should in the arms  shoulder  chest    then the waist was huge  just hung off of me like a flour sack  it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic  combine that with the high low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject  sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have  or want to appear to have  an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for
great idea, in theory sctrachy  short  boxy  stiff   loved the idea of this sweater  but this was not what i was hoping for
if you want a crop top... i love everything about this except the length  i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me  the quality is good  thick and substantial  color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well  just weird proportions so sadly  going back 
way too scratchy! the minute i put this sweater on  i couldn t wait to take it off  it was way too scratchy for me  so  for those with any type of sensitivity to wool  this is not the sweater for you  otherwise  i thought the design was quite cute 
strange fit note the sleeves on the model  that is how your regular size will fit your arms  however  even if you have skinny arms like i do  the sleeves will be tight  i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only   ft   in  i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested  the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon 
okay but not at this price i feel that for this price  i should love this top  and i wanted to   however  the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top  and there were a few things about it that could be improved   pros  i ordered a medium and feel that it s pretty true to size  additionally  the fabric is nice and light  but also  sheer   and  generally speaking  has a nice pattern  overall  it s a very pretty top   cons  there s a cute criss cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly
not worth the money much lower quality than other robes i have purchased
doesn't wash well i wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product  label says that you can wash and dry normally  however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not  the robe will now not lay flat  the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut  extremely disappointed  for a      garment  i expected much more  i wish i could return this 
disappointed so bummed  i was really hoping this top would work for me  i got the black in regular size   and the pink in petite size    both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section  i have a sort of short torso  wear a small   c  and am have a defined waist  when tops are bulky  it gives me no shape and just looks terrible  i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure  they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out  the constr
nan this is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer  it is basically a big shaggy box from the front  and from the side it looks like a tent  it is also short 
nan i have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun  i really wanted to like it  but i could not  there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice  each time there were some on the floor  they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress  i fear it would be a dress for one season and i d have to throw it out  not for that price  so back it goes 
shrank when washed i loved this tunic the first time i wore it  i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots   just what i wanted  it fit true to size  even with a few extra pounds around the chest area  imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash   having followed the directions on the tag exactly   and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly  in particular the sleeves became incredibly  uncomfortably tight and much sh
looks better in the pic than real life i really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs  i prefer a s petite but it is sold out  the xs arrives and while i still like the color  the fit is really weird  the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long  it looks nothing like the photo  i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model s collar bone  despite eliding the color  the design is off so have to return 
no way this sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off  it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it  it was uneven and stretched out  it looked like it was not well made to me  it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz  i returned this one 
not worth the price. this sweater was just okay  i am happy to pay      or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price  i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it  retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less  i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer  looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments 
lovely color this sweater is a lovely color and very soft  however  the sweater  sheds  terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance  it s also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through 
nan the material is very nice  not flimsy at all which is nice  the problem was the fit around the arms  i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn t cover me bra  i ll be returning it 
such a great, classic top with a big issue i really like both colors in this top  i love the way it lays  the length  the material  etc  what i don t like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra  this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it s warm enough to go sleeveless  too bad  i would have bought it for sure 
the dress looks very elegant on the website i was so excited to buy it online  but it come in a small plastic bag  and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got  so i had to return it
poor fit i ordered this top on line  i wanted to love it  but unfortunately the fit was not for me  i am     with a long torso  this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top 
stiff fabric i was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail  when it arrived  i was very disappointed  the color is more mauve than dusty pink  and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled     not at all what i expect velvet to be  flowy and soft   the fabric seems very cheap for the price point   i usually like floreat  but this one is headed right back to the store 
very sheer and shorter than shown beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows  i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible   the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person  the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser    over
i wanted to like this this shirt is adorable   but   it didn t work for me   i m a smaller gal with a large chest          g   i tried on the small  since it seemed so flowy and large  the sleeves were tight  yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much  making the shirt look huge on me  perhaps a more fitted back  and i would have been in love   love the blue color 
on the fence --- some problems the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige  well  i m blonde with fair skin  so i m not sure this is going to work  it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality    i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy    but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual  i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
needs a better discription i was so excited for this to arrive  at the end of last summer  my favorite shirt  you know the kind   dresses up or down with ease   it s your go to for work or a night out with friends  was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement  i thought that this would be a good contender  but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag       firstly  the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph   in person its more of a peachy off whte instead of white  still pr
nan nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesn t fall well  also  as has happened to me before  retailer sent me a dress clearly worn used and returned by someone else with hair all over it  you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out 
meh it s a rather boring tank  i thought it d be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it  the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves 
poor fit i am        lb and an xs petite the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering    the huge puffy sleeves especially  another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right  not worth the price on sale 
cute but not appropriate for work! i wanted this skirt to work  it is soft  comfortable  and cute  unfortunately  it runs to short   i am      and would not be able to pull it off at work  i ordered a bigger size and it still didn t work 
super cropped sweater i was so excited to get this in the mail    and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel  i don t know why it looks like a normal length on the model  im returning it 
strike out i ve been waiting to purchase this top for some time  thinking it would be perfect weight for fall winter  i m pretty disappointed  since i don t live close to an retailer  i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal  this sweater however i was swimming in  like a child in an adult sweater  it was huge  and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape  i wasn t impressed with the material either  it f
did not like the shape the quality of the shirt is top notch  the fabric is lightweight and comfortable   now the cons   this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo  definitely not for me 
promising, but frumpy i so wanted to love this sweatshirt  it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material  the pattern is pretty  and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it  unfortunately  the body of the sweatshirt  particularly the front torso area  was too big  and it popped out around me like a balloon  the arms fit well  so i don t think that i could have gone down a size  i was also not keen on the way the neck hung  which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded
bulky, unflattering i was surprised by the other reviews  expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward  the hi low cut with so much bulk just wasn t flattering  i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body  the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more  it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i d hoped  it went back 
not flattering on me fits like a maternity top  not for my age group or build 
cute but poorly made weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags   the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel  needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing  not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash 
can't wear a bra and it is see through this is a great dress if you don t want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples 
itchy and odd fit i was so bummed when this came in   the colors and print are beautiful  but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic ruffle combo  there is also a liner which is a nice touch  but it s significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts  definitely going back 
this top is just meh wasn t crazy about this top  it looked great online but in person it s just a boring and lifeless top 
odd neckline i loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store  i am      with a slender build  i tried my usual xs but couldn t manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline  the band is so small even fully stretched out  i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder    i gave up after wrestling with it  i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me   funny    but not funny 
slouchy my   daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between     and        this dress was sloppy on every one of us  i don t think a size x small would have made a difference  the length is all over the place  i m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture  on the positive side was very soft  it may work as a beach cover  up 
striped tank dress tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress  it s just a shapeless  thin  beach cover up that i could ve picked up anywhere  the yellow color is so cute though  if you re looking for a light  breezy  go to the beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it s too thin for just about anything else 
very sheer and see through i purchased this in the yellow xs  it is very comfortable  but extremely see through  you d have to wear a slip or something underneath it  but i m not sure what would work based on the style  and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see through  unfortunately i had to return it 
sheer shoulders one can t tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent  it also is very long almost dress length   feels less quality than what retailer usually carries 
beautiful but won't last! i feel in love with this piece  the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments  it lifted my mood just wearing it  sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed  upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached  i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear  so sad  they should recreate this in a heavy fabric 
nan read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item    however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap  didn t even try it on  so sad  but i still love retailer   
quality does not merit cost i generally don t write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost  the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer s tag is at the back of the neck  the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment  i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a     item of clothing 
nan beautiful fabric  unfortunately  i had to return it  after just one wear  it had pills all over the side  fabric is too delicate  sad to return 
material is awful love retailer s kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it  unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me     off    went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it  i love retailer but for     this is not worth your money 
stunning, but fabric is too thin the colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the  delicateness  of the material  it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray   including next to the kimono s label  so sad 
smaller arms, larger body i ll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful  the top is sheer  but that s pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse  the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso  not the chest  but the mid section  is cut fairly wide  i m           #    b and usually wear a   or a small medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit  i purchased this in a    the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an    chest was as expect
nan it is soft and hangs great  problem   i wore it one time   and the back balled up terrible  it looked like i had owned it for years   not worn it one time  wouldn t recommend  though it is sooooo soft 
not skinny enough to wear this love the softness and the length  the color was perfect  but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body  the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections  will be returning the sweater 
ribbed cardigan this cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer  the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap 
great design poor execution the dress is absolutely beautiful in person  the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted  it s unique and sure to turn heads  being      i tried on the small petite  this size is usually perfect  lengthwise  for me  however this dress was about    too long  another complaint is the style of the top half  the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half  the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am  not a good look on anyone 
garish this may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried  the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish  the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap  the skirt is an antebellum nightmare     i did not even want to try it on  it s that bad  i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified   for reference  i m        approximately the height  size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes  i wanted to like it 
nice styling but shapeless thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack  love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses  shame this did nothing for my curves  ordered an    usually wear a    and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders  if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me 
looks like pajamas, not flattering i love jumpsuits for their style and comfort  i loved the look of this blue silky piece  and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house  i agree that it is like lounge wear  but for me  there were a few challenges     first  the fit was small  i am usually anywhere between a   and a   depending on style  cut and brand  i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel  it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th
swallowed me up! don t be fooled by the photos online  the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue  it s a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy  it s so unflattering  i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true  this dress just hung on me and pulled me down  i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it 
confirmed: a tent i should have listened to previous reviewers  but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures  when it arrived in the mail  i realized this is a mistake  it has no shape  material is poofy and feels cheap  it is going back 
nan this is so close to perfect  but there s a seam down the middle of the back and they didn t bother to match the polka dots  you can see the mismatch in the second photo  i was about to buy the jacket  and totally in love  when i turned and saw the error  i hoped it was one bad match  but nope  on every one  couldn t unsee  didn t buy  very disappointed 
does not hang well i am typically a small   in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down  it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack  the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight  i am          lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress 
nan i bought these and returned them almost immediately  the material looks nice  but itchy and heavy  the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear 
nan really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out  when it arrived it was heavy   bulky in the package which didn t bode well  taking it out of the bag  i was surprised at how heavy   thick it was  the picture really looks like it would be a flowy  grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day   but in the reality you might drown in sweat  the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric     wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate
it's a tent! as much as i buy from retailer  this is my first review  the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person  i wanted something that was a bit flowy  but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie  the most unflattering dress ever and since it s only available online  i m not interested enough to try a smaller size 
nan i tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer  it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom  so if you re expecting  this one would be great 
nope this top completely fell short for me  i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting  in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn t even noticeable but in person it is very prominent   and not in a good way  the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well  did not work well with my large bust    d   returned 
not satisfied not great quality  runs a bit lose  disproportionate  too large in neck and arms area 
swingy and cute but too wide i ordered a size small  usually i am ps  but wanted the extra length  usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time  such a cute style but made me look short   wide  unfortunately it s going back
not as pictured this top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is      without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture  the fit is designed to be loose  so i don t think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down  i ve included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back  it s still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting  i m debating on
wider and swingier than pictured this top looks so pretty on the model  however  the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose  i am petite but between a c  to d cup  the top is not really fitted  so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece  from the side it hung way in front of my body  i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model  if you are smaller chested and taller  this top might look nice on you  i am           lbs and c d cup  i really loved the fabric and c
comically bad. i don t normally write reviews  but this shirt was so terrible  that i felt inspired      first off  the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo  secondly  there is no shape whatsoever  unlike in the photo  it bells out like a tent  it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not  overall  this shirt is an insult to the female form      retailer  what is with all of these shapeless  frocks in cheap f
wanted to love this! i was excited to see this top  ordered it and was disappointed  it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom  i tried this on   times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments  no luck 
it's just horrible.. well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time  i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons  fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target 
porportions seem odd the design of this dress was very off for my           lb    d frame  it s low cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there  a belt didn t help much  the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy 
runs quite large the photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides  and just below her hair  there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat  well  it s not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl  i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing  the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater  bummer  i ll be returning it 
beautiful dress but very large this dress is beautiful and unique   the cutouts and lace really stand out  however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers  i usually get a   or  p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the   regular was huge and the armholes really big  the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short  while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling  for reference  i am    waist
nan i thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy 
weird bunching in the front this was disappointing to me  i love how this looks on the model  unfortunately it made me look huge  it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on  i didn t find it was tts  i am a    m and got the m  it was too tight in the waist  before i d even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small  i don t even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching  it s like the buttons didn t match up or something 
nan i got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas  it looked adorable  and long   on the model  however  it doesn t even cover my butt  that s how short it is  if you re anything over       i d say it ll be too short for leggings 
didn't work for me the cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn t flatter my shape  i think it would work better on someone very thin  the criss cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn t sit right  even worse  the bust portion made me look flat  and i m a full c cup  
wrinkled! the dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it  it looked beautiful until i sat down  the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day  can t wear this again 
disappointing after reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress  it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed  first of all  it s huge  the medium was way too big on me  and i m never a small at retailer   i even considered ordering the large in this   my normal size at retailer   second  the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo  and the fabric felt cheap  finally  it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn t fit right 
way too big i ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice   once i tried it on it was way too big in hips   i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides   i returned the dress 
horrible i cannot imagine this dress working in any size  i am a small  thin and average height woman  usually a       in pants  a size   c bust  and      tall   this dress was huge  i sized down to a     i am always a   in dresses  and this dress was still big    i do not know if i could size down to a   though as the shoulders seemed to fit right  it was ginormous  i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be   months pregnant  it still wouldn t work unless i was   months pregnant and carrying tr
nan as the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips it was ridiculous  i don t know how anyone could wear it looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip  i m long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well  very very strangely constructed i couldn t keep it even at the deeply discounted price
nan i ordered this in a size   which i thought would be a small and it was very  very wide  it is very short too  i typically wear a small and am      and     lbs  it s going back unfortunately  very soft material though 
strange, unflattering fit this top did nothing for me  it billowed in the front and was not flattering  for reference  i am          pounds  and small chested  i ordered the smallest size the top came in  cannot recall if it was an xs or     i promptly returned it 
snug and unflattering would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves  i m average size and a mother of    the medium was not a true medium  the fabric was amazing  the arm holes were too open low cut for my taste    i m      and      this landed mid calf  not my preference      retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under   weeks from receiving it 
just okay this might look good on you if you are very tall and slim  i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering  it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places  the color is not true  it is black stripes on gray  not cream   i thought the stripes might flatter my shape  but alas  i did not look good in this   the material is very nice  soft and stretchy 
clings to the body i love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model  but on me it looked tacky   i m     and     lbs  and this dress hit me in all the wrong places   i got a size small  sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress  and the arm holes are already dangerously large    i wish this were just a little bit a line   instead  it s literally like someone just extended the length of a t shirt 
very poor quality i usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived  the fabric smelled plastic y which is a first for me with retailer products  when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn t noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it  this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores  i can t believe retailer is selling this 
nice idea !!! i really wanted to love this waistcoat  i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it  it runs large  but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing  the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed  the hip area       i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs  but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size  it s going back  but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative      
be warned: these pants snag on everything these pants are gorgeous when you first see them  they fit beautifully when you first put them on  and then you wear them for one day  and they snag  on everything  and little strings start to come out of the pants  and the hem begins to unravel  and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them      after one day      i can t begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
not that flattering i love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering  the neck line fits a little weird  too bad  color was nice though  i returned the top 
nan i wanted to love this dress  it really has no style  i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung  i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight  had to return it 
runs extremely large huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness    not like represented picture  and it snags very easily  i have a   mo  old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places   i m going to see about returning it with the snags 
shift dress strangely sized just piping in here    ordered my usual size of small petite  the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift  and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely  i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting  i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua 
a good idea, but... i really love the idea behind this  however  the fit doesn t work for me  i m usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops  this one runs small though   the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width  the neckline was very high  higher than it looks in the model photo  and the armholes were too big  so i don t think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue  the other criticism is that the front is not lined 
nan frumpy   looked like a nightgown on me  maybe  better on someone younger    
very sheer this dress was adorable   fit great  regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn t lined 
pretty but.... the lace and fit were good  but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy ish the dress is  it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something  and i hated the  outside  middle material  hated it  it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace  maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece 
wanted to like it, but the fit is just off i love the design and the fabric  but the fit is just off on this dress  the area around the bust is just not fitted well  the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat  that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress  but the waist also sat too high on me  maybe i m long waisted  who knows    so between the super high waist and the flannel type fabric  it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me  i wish it weren t so  i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
poor quality, unflattering fit this is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer  i was so excited for the shirt  it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures  the flax is very scratchy  marring the softness of the rest of the fabric  the top half is totally sheer  requiring a cami  the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way  unnecessarily adding visual pounds  finally  the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long  wh
disappointing fit--too small i ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it  the color was just as pretty in person  the thick eyelet panel was well done  the problem is the whole tank was much smaller tighter than pictured  i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit  i m pear shaped  so the hip area looked terrible  but  the whole top just wasn t up to the typical fitting standards for xl  retailer has done much better in the pas
bad fabric i so loved this dress online  not so much in person  first of all it didn t fit my build  i m      with a   f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering  mainly i m returning it because of the fabric  the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out  my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed  basically it s the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat  if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful  why they made i
very disappointed regretfully  this dress is on its way back for an exchange  the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size  i ordered it in both colors  however  the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress  and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom  again  the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching  pulls   or tears for an exchange  but i can t pay      for a dress that is already torn 
massive and unflattering agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape  unflattering overall  i normally wear a size   of   and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare  unlined and it itches 
nan this dress is so pretty  a true cinderella dress  that s why i can t find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic  i don t understand much about fabrics  but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent  i bought a size     which is what i wear in moulinette souers  i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand   the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering  i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
beautiful dress but sleeves were too tight i loved this dress  it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves  the dress has an overall relaxed fit  but the sleeves were way too tight  i had to send back because of sleeves 
had high hopes i ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work  but the previous reviews were exactly correct  the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit  the bottom has lots of fabric  which wouldn t be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit  then the bottom becomes overwhelming  i am      and     so i have a slim build and couldn t get the bodice to zip in a small  the medium would have needed altering  which wouldn t have fixed the extra fabric on th
lovely design. quality horrendous. i adore the feel and cut of these culottes  but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer  picks  piles  and serious wear and tear after just one day  i feel as if i wasted my money 
boxy and big but pretty material another tent like tee  this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice  but   it is really boxy and i m just tired of that look  the longer sleeves are a plus for fall 
not for women with curves! i am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes  i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips    but for those of us with curves  i m a size     hourglass   these are very unflattering  they made me look like i was carrying an extra       pounds  just around the hips  so bummed because they look so cute on the model 
cute but too short this dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short  i would not have felt comfortable bending over  it was a tad too full which wasn t flattering either   i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable   i need to return it  
reminds me of my mamaw i got these in the mail today and to me  they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the   s  they were super comfy but not cute at all on me  they do run large like other reviews say  i am usually an      or med and these in the small were the right choice  going back because they just look horrible on me though
thin fabric super cute but the fabric was so thin   flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it 
not for me... on me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy  i am        dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt  not fitted at all  i ordered a large  not being sure of fit  i have a flat stomach and it just hung    yuck  honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn t consider a medium  i think it would a tad better but not worth the price 
for hourglass figures? my v shape figure  broad shoulder  narrow hips  waist not well defined  looked completely square in this  not flattering at all  perhaps better for other figures 
nothing special the sweater was nice but not as long as on the model  it was itchy also  this sweater was not what i had expected  their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash  sorry retailer  i sent it back  
nan i m a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer  i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store  even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it  i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it  the quality was truly awful  i m not even sure why it is being sold  the neckline was warped and wouldn t lie flat again the neck or chest  the bottom hem was crooked  it was really bad  also having purchased tees in similar material befo
great concept but terrible execution as the previous reviewer mentioned  the pockets ruin this dress  pockets  usually such a good idea  but here they re misplaced  right on the hips  and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress  so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress    not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets  this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss 
white is a dull shade, not bright white i ordered the xl in white  for fit  it s true to size  it matches the model s photos  it s a comfortable top  the shape is good with the pleating  but  the color is definitely off  it s as if the white fabric was pre washed with navy  it s not the fresh  crisp white shown  at least for the one i received      the quality of the material is basic  the black version might be the better one overall  i m going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try  overall  i don t think it s worth ful
fit is weird i might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all  a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small  for me  it s not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short  rather than     as it states on the website  it s more like       which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person  i don t even want to go regular size because it would ve been too big  i saw some photos that others po
i agree with the whimsy comments  the detail is lovely   especially the dragonflies on the sleeve  and the quality is there with the lining  trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape  imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank  i looked at the model  after purchasing  and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering 
shapeless this cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un fitted  i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste line  the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful 
way too much material first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress  but the fit is extremely loose  they could take out an entire    inches of material and it would still be a swing dress  the photo of the back of the model  where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate  if it was  i would love this dress  the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs   straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline  i am     
flowly this dress is really nice and lightweight  the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely  but  it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves  it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering  i really wanted to like it because it s so breezy but a tad matronly on me 
don't bend over totally see through 
online way different from in person this dress is very thick cotton material  like a sweatshirt  i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best  the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric 
doesn't breath the stone color was nice  but the material is heavy and doesn t breath  if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item  upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last 
not for me i am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me  sleeves were especially long 
boxy this shirt is unflattering and boxy  it does not look cute at all on me  i am returning 
boxy, shapeless but weighty. this material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless  it was not flattering at all on my shape  i don t think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest 
beautiful but binding slip i tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress  there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress 
a shirt, not a dress unfortunately this top is shirt length  and i m only       needs to be about    longer  made of sweatshirt material  which i wouldn t mind if it were longer  also runs very wide  ordered an xs and could have gone smaller 
horrible! this dress is horrible  i can t believe they can get away with calling it a  dress   it should have been called a tunic or shirt  it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way  it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff  it came to the top of my thighs  i can t find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it  the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth 
runs large i so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail  i got a size small  my usual  and it ran so large i wasn t even sure an xs would ve fit properly  the material looked lighter and blouse y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of  hangs   underarms run large and are gaping from the body  i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can t work on me 
so disappointed! i couldn t wait to get this top in the mail since they didn t have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit  the white is completely see thru  i can t believe how sheer the material is   especially for the price  even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it    the fit runs small  and short 
felt cheap, not like retailer this top seemed so unique online  but in person it was really nothing like the pics  super full  shorter cut  the quality wasn t what i thought it would be  i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday    but this wasn t any of those things  
beautiful top, but ill filtting this top is gorgeous and beautifully made  however  the fit leaves a lot to be desired  the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin  i tried to make this work but just couldn t  so it s going back 
lovely idea that does not work i was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern  however the embroidery takes away any stretchy ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full figured lusciousness  the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top  i wanted to keep this but h
boxy i loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy  i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige cream it represents it better  it made me look very wide  loved it online but it wasn t for me  returned it 
loved it but it ran. . . absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching  it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool    lining in a mustard color  i did a cold water wash and flat to dry  i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching      i am so disappointed b c i loved this top 
design is stamped on from the photos  i thought the design was embroidered  in reality  it is stamped on  there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins  but overall  the design is just printed on the fabric  i didn t feel it looked good  in fact it looked kind of cheap to me  so i returned it  the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual  i was disappointed it didn t work out 
nan the cut is small  i am           lbs and usually wear     medium pants  medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear the polyester will be hot in summer  returning for another brand 
too short i m a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small  so  i ordered this in a small  and the top was a little loose  but it was way too short  there s no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public  i m       and the hem was higher than mid thigh on me  the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape 
not fit for travel i purchased these pants on         as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february  after about       wears  with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling  the pants wore through in between my legs  the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places  i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could
cute but not practical top is completely see through  i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like  it is a cute design but not practical at all 
cute online, but.... i agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large  or something    i ordered an xs  my usual size  xs s  the body of the shirt is very loose  the upper arms are a bit snug  and i don t have large arms  the shoulder seams are in a very strange place  but when you look at the model  it doesn t look so bad  with the shirt i received  and another reviewer  the seam was puffy  making for a strange look  in theory  the shirt should have worked  but didn t  i loved the pattern  not the fit 
too short i had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short  it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on  unfortunately it had to go back  bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix 
not for me i loved the look of this sweater on line  but it just didn t work for me  the fit wasn t good enough  the style okay  the color fine  the feel  scratchy  overall  it did not work for my body 
too big with very odd arms i really wanted to love this shirt  the snowflake and stripe design is really cute  and the fabric is of nice quality  it s a very loose fit  which i would ve been willing to work with  but    as mentioned in previous reviews  the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm  and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long  it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms  not attrac
high rise agree with above review  these are described totally wrong  they are not     rise  they are very high rise  so much that i didnt even try them on   the color isnt good either  it looks like a cheap levi s color or just not a quality denim  if you like high rise  you might like them  i can t comment on fit  
ichy. i made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews  cute design but not as comfy as it looks  returned immediately 
nan this top runs huge  not only in the torso chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy  i am normally between a m l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work 
so disappointed #2 the review above titled  so disappointed  couldn t have said it any better  the dresses from last year are perfect  i probably wear them at least once a week  i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year  i m generally an xs or s in dresses  however i have xxs from last year s version   and the xs in this one is lifeless  it s heavy  hot  doesn t have the same nice shape as last year  i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres
disappointed was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses   however this looks huge  the material is not soft so it doesn t fall well  it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant  
so disappointed! i was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all   colors  when i saw this new one  i was thrilled and ordered it immediately  what a disappointment  why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing  the fabric is a very loose weave sort of  homespun  look  which wouldn t be a deal breaker  but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags  last year s styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move  this version is fully lined  yo
huge this dress is huge  i am normally a l xl regular in retailer brands  i love a loose  flowy dress  after trying one on in the store  just a random returned petite xl  i ordered the petite medium  and it was still huge and not flattering  so sad  i wanted to love this  loved the material and colors  but way off 
not like the pic the yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics  fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning 
incredibly unflattering i ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous  i really loved it until i put it on  wow it was bad  i ordered a small  normally a sm med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material  it wasn t long but rather incredibly boxy  one of the most unflattering things i ve ever tried at retailer 
beautiful shirt on model but no i really fell in love with this shirt  i am about     and     pounds  i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide  i was ready to fly  although the model wears this shirt really nicely  i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body  not quite sure what that is     also this shirt is shorter than what i expected  it looks a lot longer on the model  i had to return this shirt 
not what i expected i gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right  boy was i wrong  this is a sweater knit with a very deep v neck that s incredibly boxy and unattractive  the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on  i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium  it was swimming on me  the stripes aren t as cute in real life
really, really horrible, try again, retailer! i had such high hopes for this top  the colors  the peplum  the ruffles  the price point  the fit was terrible  unflattering  and laughable  please try again with this one  retailer  you could have a real winner with a little tweaking 
nan c mon  the accent is wrong  a simple google search would prevent this 
not my cup of tee it fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me 
hello shower curtain i noticed this top on one of the sales associates  and it looked great  she s probably    lbs and about       tried it on and it looked horrible  i even tried sizing down twice  i m      and the ruffles started right under my chest  i gave   stars bc of the material  it is light  and summery 
nan this shirt runs gigantic and it s not even cute  i  m done buying retailer online 
unflattering i own many blouses by tiny  the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me  the shirt was just blah 
not white... i really wanted to love these because i love my other steps  but they did not feel or fit the same way at all  i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white  these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me  sadly  these will be going back 
nan ugh  the fit of this dress is terrible    what a beautiful dress though    the material and the colors    had so much potential  but  the fit is awful    i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok  if not a tad big  but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn t even zip it without a ton of effort  i don t think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger  disappointing 
not soft like other cloth and stone tops i own     other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material  this one missed the mark  not soft and very thick  not what i was expecting 
shapeless i loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available  unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival  besides being more muted color wise  the sizing is way off  i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me  on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent  i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric     though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow  also  it
inconsistent i m not sure what it is with ag  i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans  in blue  black and white denim  i wish i could say they re all great  but unfortunately there s a big variation in how they wash  depending on the fabric content  i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring  but after washing them once i can see they won t be a favorite pair  even with cold water and hanging them to dry  the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes  at this price po
vieques shift nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized  material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person 
different material i was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one  i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket  i ve borrowed my friends   i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body  it s disappointing considering the price you pay  i would return if it still had tags on 
sizing way off i love relaxed fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these  i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin  unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up  i d need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all  very disappointed  will l
linty & pills this jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif  however  it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store  this piece will look bad worn old in a very short period of time  it s a big shame  because it s so perfect in every other way  i choose not to buy it  it s very expensive for the quality 
not the original! for those who are wondering this sweater coat is     lambswool and     acrylic  the original version of this coat was      lambswool      acrylic yet the price remained the same   i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in      lambswool like the original version  this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials 
disappointed: runs small, arrived looking worn i read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large  this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer  i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater  this was not the case  the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind  and i assume the model is taller than i   as models are usually tall   for reference  i am        medium build
cute design but unflattering fit this had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me   it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy 
not so flattering. i thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me  i actually didn t mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn t want to keep it for   look  the material felt inexpensive  the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself  i m      and about     lbs 
really wanted to love this i was so excited to get this in the mail  and so disappointed when i put it on  it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up  but i don t really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror   lumpiness along the seams  i don t know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not  but it gave me lumpy looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid thigh area  returned it the next day 
very pink on my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink   very washed put pinks   looked awful on me as brunette  maybe will work for someone who likes pastels  overall style was also disappointing  just hung  this went back 
not cute this blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect  when i got it it looked like a big box and didn t fit anywhere  the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge  i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big  sadly  i had to return it 
nan looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style  the material seems great quality but it s stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung  i m a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me  back it goes 
nan i love how these jeans look on  tts  adorable  i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket  pair #   the stitching came out in the exact same place  this seems to be a problem with the quality sewing  the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined   nd pair has to go back  too bad 
nan i m very disappointed in the quality  it seems more like a pajama than a tunic  definitely not worth        dollars  i plan to return it 
nan the material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality  it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash  i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering  returning asap 
too big! i ordered a small  which is my usual retailer size  but this was like a tent on me  it s fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn t what i was looking for  also it is very long  a very weird amount of long  also there is only eyelet on the front  the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric  i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing 
not as depicted the catalog shot and model shot are completely different  it s like not even the same dress  the neckline  color  the quality of lace
nan i really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i m giving it a   because i shirt should last longer than   months  i ve taken it to the cleaners   times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes 
beautiful beading-too boxy detailed beading was beautiful  it s too boxy  way to much fabric in the waist bust and tight on the hips  it doesn t fall boxy boyfriend like  the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture  was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days bummed 
horrible quality, no structure i recently purchased this blouse on their     off sale in white  i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse  i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway  it is awful  there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning  it feels like a napkin or thinner  not even worth the extra sale price  i will be returning 
wanted to love...but bought this cami tank on sale which i m glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted  it kinda just drapes under the cami   the problem is it s not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank    but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through that was higher than the bottom of my chest   so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra undergarment   it simply looks awkward    not sure if it would ve been better
red got this in purple and love it  ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn t fit well like the purple  not sure what happens  maybe miss sized 
think material; poorly made i tried this on at my local store  i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it  alas  it was not to be  the material is super thin  almost see through  and it is of poor quality  i did not buy it 
only lasted one wash don t even waste your money  even on sale     bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers  unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash  i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through  one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad  the third one still has the tag  keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color   but will only be using it as a knock
waist crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around  the waist section  where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didn t lay well  i am           lbs    c      waist  and     hip usually wear a   or extra small in the maeve clothing that isn t a fitted style  i bought the s  which fit well except for the waist issue described above  this is a fitted dress  i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received  it is a great style idea 
poor quality the material is thin and of poor quality   it snagged the first time i wore it  the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated 
cute, but poorly made i bought this top in two colors  i think it s a really cute  easy top to wear  but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality  i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming  which i m sure will be a hole in no time  two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally  i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears 
nan is gigantic it could be so cute  but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low  i am   feet    and     pounds  and a small was huge on me 
nan usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one  i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top  possibly better on smaller chests  the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good  not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs  going back   
prettier in pic! i just returned this top  i agree with the previous reviewer  the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it  also the ruffles didn t look so great on me either 
poor fit the fit of this sweater did not flatter my body type  the top half did not fit well  the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward 
very see thru i ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru  it s true   had to return it
nan the shirt is cute  but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct  it s a crop top  this was returned 
expensive circus-wear this top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear  i thought this looked whimsical  fun and a well designed piece when i saw it on line  especially at this high price  i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today  it is not expensive looking at all  and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail  it is a bit juvenile too  even if you wore it and were going for  ironic   it would be difficult to
see through! i read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot  it is soooo see through  this trally could only be worn on a beach  very disappointed 
nan the blouse is lovely   but after washing it exactly as specified  it shrank more than a full size  this is an expensive hand me down for my daughter   
nice design but poorly executed i was really eager to receive this sweater  i was expecting the same as in the picture  i received it today and i am already returning it  first of all the sweater didn t look new  it is mostly shapeless  it has little balls and piling on the wool  what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months  and the metallic color makes it look cheap  in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places  it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col
cute dress, runs huge the style was really cute but the fit was huge  i ordered an xs  i don t think going to the xxs would have helped  i ended up returning it 
beautiful suit that was not well tested i wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections  seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit 
huge i was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater  the sweater looks like it s falling apart and it is huge  i would not recommend this even at a clearance price 
nan colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that s where it ends  cheap flimsy polyester and no lining  far too expensive for what it is  on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great  i would say it runs a tad big but in my case   i have wide shoulders  not big enough to downsize  too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress 
nan looked really cute on line  arrived with a large hole in the front  quality and look was very cheap    would not recommend this sweater at all  step it up please retailer 
nan this picture does not represent these jeans    the color is way off  they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture  they also run very small 
strange cut i usually like coats and wraps with high waisted belts  but this way too high  and the fit was really unflattering  i can see it being chic on a tall  slender person  but it s definitely not right for my short  curvy body  returning it today 
nan how cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south      until i washed it  i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out  first of all  the smell was unbelievable  i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk  even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end 
poor quality sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is  i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life  this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style  another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump   i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was         
disappointing purchased this in two colors online  purchased in an xs   i am usually a s or xs  the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering  returning both 
huge i want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl   with sizing like this  one size fits all could just about do it 
cute but cheap looking up close i bought this outfit online on sale   so i only paid      but i think if i saw it in person first  i probably wouldn t have purchased it  while the design is cute  the fabric is beyond cheap  it s not just polyester   it s like a plastic polyester  i think if you dress it up with high heels  necklace  armful of bangles  you can probably distract from the fabric               lb  purchased xs and it s a little big still 
so flimsy i buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i m a sucker for embroidered flowers  everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can t even believe it  like when i held it up in the dressing room  i could see through the entire shirt  front to back  before even putting it on  once on  i could see everything through it  i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on  it s so frail  i own so many tiny shirts and while
cute in theory cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the    s vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern  maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible  i sent it back  i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving  i wouldn t buy this top at any price based on
amazing pattern just not the right shape for me. i saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself  i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light  i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips  i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape  if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it  it is beautiful 
see through potato sack the title says it all  looks very pretty online though 
itchy itchy itchy! let me start off by saying how pretty this top is  and heavy  and itchy   you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top  with your arms not touching any part of the top   the sequins will itch if you put your arms down  underneath the armhole    another reason i didn t like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable   i would have to get mine tailored for my      frame   i usually wear a medium or     in tops and ordered this in a medium  it was roomy 
so disappointed like other reviewers  i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it  well  i am very disappointed  the colors aren t as rich as the outdoor photo  although they re brighter than shown in the studio photos  this is just not a flattering dress  i ve put it on three times and taken it back off  the neck is too high  the sleeves are too narrow  and i have really skinny arms   and there s no  swing  to it  i am      and weigh     pounds and bought a size small  which is what
this is not the original i bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer  it was stunning  the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate  i regretted not purchasing it immediately        fast forward to today    the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores  the fabric was different  there was hardly any beading  and the colors were washed out and dull      i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo  but t
very short! this top is very beautiful and the color is a dream  but wow is it short  i m      and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans  the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected  it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse      because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt  i wouldn t recommend this to women who are busty curvy on top  it made my chest look huge  this styling may work for petite ladies  but tall   curvy ladies beware 
way way too big i loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me  i drove to the store to purchase it  however  when i tried it on  i was so disappointed  the print is adorable and it is made of great quality  but the swing style is definitely more than mini  i could have fit   of myself in this dress  it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs  also  the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos  and the floral print isn t as r
nan i really wanted to love this dress  it is absolutely beautiful   the color  design and details  however  whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves  it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy  though i am slender  i have a chest  maybe that was the problem 
too small! had to return this for a couple of reasons     was too small  it s made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand  i didn t bother to order a size up because i wasn t sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large     the main color isn t grey  like the picture  it s a black and white checkered pattern  so  it doesn t look at all grey irl     i m still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea
fantastic design but poorly made i absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i d be wearing them all summer long  they fit beautifully  were true to size  and seemed to go with every top i owned  unfortunately  on the second wear  the inseam completely unraveled  leaving a foot long gaping hole in the leg  i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams  so i m not thrilled with the quality  it seems like they were poorly manufactured  i m not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
nan this dress is thin and completely see through  it is definitely not worth the price tag  would be really cute in a thicker material 
awful i don t know who this would fit  looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress       but just looked like a sack  i think the  knit  must have stretched into an unnatural shape   especially the arms 
odd fit the color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful  it was too  swingy  and made me look like i gained   lbs instantly   i m          lbs   i will be unfortunately returning this item 
disappointed! the tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it s tissue paper thin  also  i ordered it in two sizes   xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit  i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large  the armholes hit halfway to my waist  obviously i didn t even bother opening the size s  both will be returned 
not what i expected i ordered two sizes  when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin  both shirts were in the bag  the style is just okay  the shirt is extremely light weight  i was not impressed with the fabric  i am returning both  definitely did not think it was worth the price 
stumpy arms when i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous  i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be  they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child s dress arms on my dress 
beautiful color but baggy fit i wanted to love this sweater  the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful  however when i put it on  it added at least    pounds to my frame  unfortunately it s going back since the cut just doesn t work on my frame 
runs huge! this is a great top but it is really big  i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected  this top is easily   inches wider everywhere  i would love to exchange it for an extra small  but am afraid that even that size would be too large  the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy  which is perfect for warm days  but the size issue is out of control 
just okay the skirt is just okay  the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through  there is a slip which goes to mid thigh  very strange and felt weird as well  the pleats are okay but not great  overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that  and again  be wary of it being see through 
good in theory but too large i typically wear a size    xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl  it s more of a t shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge  it s nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l  this would have looked like a maternity top on me 
nan in a word    clingy     and not in good way  long so you need it to flow not cling  liked the back  but front was just too clingy  back it goes 
disappointing i ordered this in cream during the     sale  i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn t try it on  when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess  it was so wrinkled that i don t think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily  i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer  it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular  it was also way too short for me  i ll be taking it back very soon  i do plan
flimsy, cheap i was so bummed by this dress  i had high hopes when i ordered it  but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived  the body of the dress is unlined fleece material    it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of  i found the fit baggy and unflattering   the  shawl  portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders   very disappointed  i already returned this 
i wanted to like this i really did  here s why i just couldn t  the lace strips make it look cheap  the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished    the fit is very disappointing  medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath    which defeated the purpose 
so disappointed in retailer's descriptions lately... and this one proved to be no different  the short end of it  this dress is pretty much super thick  heavy linen with a rope like collar  the supposed embroidery you see   and there is no lining  but completely unnecessary pockets  i m typically a   or   depending on the designer        a super fit     lbs  and knew enough to order an xs in this  however it still fit like a potato sack  even upon taking it out of the plastic bag  i knew it was going back  between the unrealistic pictures and lack
nan this dress turned out to be a huge disappointment    i was in loveee with the picture  in real life  not so much  the material felt thin and cheap  and the yellow was super yellow  nothing like the picture  i was so bummed  returned it earlier today   
colors are more intense than they appear i purchased this dress for my graduation  the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online  i m kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent  i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress  the fabric is      synthetic the fit is great  the dress is true to size
not soft i had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri  a type of alpaca  in the title  i don t know if the blend      polyamide      royal baby alpaca      fine merino  threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up  unimpressed 
boxy i love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy  the shirt was pretty much square  and the top was super itchy  too  looks so cute online but no go in person 
didn't work on me at all i had high hopes with the other positive reviews  but it didn t work on me  nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn t lay well  and didn t do my bust any favors  maybe better on those less pear shaped  hopeless on me 
beautiful but falls apart this top is absolutely gorgeous  but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash  will be returning 
really odd fit! this looked so odd on me  i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too  the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom  the top is really large  as to be unflattering  perhaps it s just that it doesn t work on someone who is petite  but this one is a return 
misleading photo i would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray  not white  either i got a strange one or  as happens to me sometimes with retailer  the pictures are very misleading  disappointed because i wanted to love this 
maybe in another fabric?? this one will be going back  the color is really blah and the fabric wasn t a texture i was expecting  it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day  overall  the cut and style is cute  but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style  this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric 
nan i so wanted to love this suit  it was gorgeous   the color  the quality  the style  but i am returning and can not recommend it  the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work  but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front  i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun  but i didn t feel like i could even walk safely  and i am not well endowed  very bummed but it s going back 
eh... i didn t really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail  i love cloth   stone and this is just not up to their normal quality  i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse  it s very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn t even tried them on yet  material is super soft  but thin  cut is weird under the arms and tight  sleeves are also tight  i am usually an xs or s in cloth   stone so i ordered smalls  i just fit the arms  but t
nan fabric much heavier than looks in picture  also nothing mentioned in the description  great color and fit but i live in florida 
nan this shirt was a cute print  but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh  i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn t worth paying the extra   on top of the    
sheer tried this on in store  was ill fitting and sheer 
total muumuu i agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge  the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well  possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about       months anyway 
nan i really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy  it did not look flattering and will be going back 
disappointed. i have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos  and have purchased many pairs  however  the last   pairs i ve ordered are all a different cut now  they are no longer the chino i loved  although they have the exact same name  they are now  boy cut   and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs  nowhere on the description does it say  boy cut   it s not until the package arrives in the mail that i m saddened to find this changed product with the same number  it really should say this int he descri
love these pants until i washed them i bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color   i didn t have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover  biokleen  and the pants were ruined  one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark   cold wash and line dried  such a bummer that these pants aren t every day wearable and washable 
poor fit this dress ran large  maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy  the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso petite frame  i loved the yellow color for summer  it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding  unfortunately  i had to return it 
supremely disappointed when i tried these on in the store i was thrilled   they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine  i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday  after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out  saggy and faded   so disappointing   i want my      back 
not for the full-busted this top looks great on the model    a petite frame  small busted body   i am      and have a large bust and curvy hips  this top hit in all the wrong places  the front looks very cropped and frumpy  if you have a large bust  the width of the top of very boxy   the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty 
dress for you and your whole family i really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this  dress   it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on  i ordered the sm med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said  are you kidding me     by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look    lbs heavier  horrible design retailer  i don t know which dress the
see through beach cover up i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress   this was not it   completely see through   i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up   but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip   its an odd design  absolutely not worth the price   i purchased the sm md and i could have for two of me in the dress  returned this piece without looking back
huge and a bit grayish you can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it s huge  the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn t expect 
color not as shown the dress is very pretty  but the sequins are dark blue  i imagined they would be silver gold  given the photo  but the dress is essentially light pink and blue 
nan it s not a bad concept but i wished for more  i wish this tunic was a  different material as it was wrinkley and drop waist design instead of at the waist  too bad  i wanted to love it but it will go back 
not as pictured i bought this dress for a holiday party  and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo  i still liked it  but when i went to try it on  it was just not working  i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look  but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted  i would recommend sizing up  but be aware that the top straps  shoulder to breast  are too loose to begin with  so they may sag   overall  i wouldn t recommend this dress for the curren
missing drawstring! this top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring  so disappointing  mailing it back 
color is not as it appears in the photo i was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress  it did not appear as it did on the photo  i was pretty disappointed by the color  the photo of the dress is much more impressive 
nan cute sweater  snap was broken when i received it  and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock  ugh 
pretty, soft, sheer got this in wine  very pretty and soft  but so sheer  even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami  returning for this reason  having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra comfort 
much shorter than in photo - shoulders tight fabric is not as rich as shown in photo  dress much shorter than shown in photo  shoulder area is tight and really doesn t blend with the material below  this isn t going to work on very many people   pear shape   just not what i ve come to expect from retailer 
shapeless in the words of my husband   looks like you re wearing a bag   i m althetic and short  maybe this works best on tall and very slim 
way to big and boxy this sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous  i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere  the quality is nice  maybe sizing down would help  but the medium large is going back  i am normally a medium 
color bleeds and discolors the pant. this is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye   the dyes in these pants are the same thing  i wore the purple color and washed in cold  gentle  cycle and they were stained      i will return these  it s too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants 
impossible to put on the bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed  it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back  you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear  once i got it on  it fit perfectly though  getting out of it was a disaster  i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip  overall  i was crushed that it didn t work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering 
not colorfast! i m so bummed  i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit  great color  so comfortable  however  i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine  so  now they have strange lighter lines running along them  not acceptable      i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue  for reference  see my stats  i bought a    
nan i loved the dress  but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed  very easy order and return  thanks 
nope. the picture makes the shorts look structured  i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material  i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester      also  this runs way too big  i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs     i wouldn t even buy this at the sale price 
not a wow i bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking  though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping  over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep 
least flattering romper ever don t be fooled by the image  unless you have a c d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle  exactly where you want it least  very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality  back it goes 
nan the shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on  sent it back  wouldn t buy even on sale 
nan i was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail  the picture looks much cuter than in person  although it s true to size  it looks pretty baggy on  also  i thought the grey  top  and blue  bottom  were too similarly colored  more contrast would have been nice  i m returning this item 
meh... this shirt was on sale  and it was a good price  that is where the goods ended    the shirt was not flattering  i sent it back asap 
too heavy the design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to   also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable   needed to return
ugly shirt really unattractive shirt  nothing good i can say about it  horrible fit  i can t imagine this would look good on anyone 
not great fit for those with long legs i finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale  i m leaving this review for women who share my body type     i m slim with longer legs  and don t really have curves  i typically don t purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than       for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m i h  jeans     these jeans have an inseam of       which i thought would be fine  but for me  the cut wasn t flattering at all  i typically look for jeans that
interesting cut these have a very interesting cut  it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall  i m about      and the size   fit in the waist  but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture  it s hard to imagine who they would look good on  they re also very poofy right below the waist 
not flattering for my body type i really wanted to like these  but they just didn t look right on my     sorta bulky frame  i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings  so maybe i m just not the right target for these  but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try  the waist was too high for my liking  and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look 
again, my bad for not looking at description... i did not like this top at all but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have  it is polyester i thought it was cotton so there s the first reason i didn t like it  secondly  there is a piece of fabric behind the laces  presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat  it wrinkles up behind the lacing  making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top  it is too long for me  the top hitting at top of thigh   this top is just reall
favorite pant---until they ripped as a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs  they are amazing for dressing up  or sassing up  and outfit  i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them  however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor  after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat  i really don t see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved  i m sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants 
fell apart after 3 wearings i loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i d ordered them  but i wore them only   times   and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days   and the seams on both legs ripped open  i think the faux leather just isn t equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings  i was super bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute  but if they can t hold up to a few casual wears  then there s just no way    thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
runs really small i m   feet     and hourglass figure  i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package  i ordered my usual small petite  the dress is so short and small you would have to be   feet    pounds  returning 
pretty but cheaply made so i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down  the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made  i really wish this were just lined dress  i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath  not worth the money  but i needed something to wear that was transitional 
such a disappointment! i fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color  it fit well and i decided to keep it  i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it  i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress  where the crocheting is  ripped open   i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price 
sloppy looking but pretty colors i ordered this style in the blue  red  yellow and white for the sale price  they all fit true to size  matching the model s photos  but  the quality is poor  the hems are frayed  they wrinkle easily  they re just a mess  the model s photos show a messy look so you know what you re getting  the positives are the colors  the blue is especially gorgeous  the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade  they are all comfortable  just sloppy looking  the sale price matches the quality  they do stretch out t
sloppy top i wanted to like this top  especially because of its comfortable material and color  but the asymmetrical shape didn t hang well on me  it also runs big   i got a small  and although the bodice fit okay  the sleeves were long  and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy  this top will be going back 
this is polyester... first problem i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct  the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not  secondly  it has a really funky  cheap  unfinished  raw hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress  the keyhole in the front is super long again  does not seem to fit the dress  i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts  length is just above knee  i am          lbs   d and the six was a good fit  sending this home t
nan really cute sweater  well made  but so intensely itchy i couldn t keep it on for more than    seconds  
poor quality for price i was really excited about this dress  the style looked like it would be a spring summer staple in my retailer heavy wardrobe  i was really surprised when i received it in the mail  the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made  for the price  i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better  i ve been an retailer fan for more than an decade  but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
disappointed should have listened   a previous review  while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning    too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great  also   this runs very large  the extra small was more like a medium 
wanted to like it i wanted to like this one   really but it was just plain sloppy looking  i returned it 
cute design, poor material i loved the fact that this dress is cotton  it is a thin cotton  and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap  mine came with a nude slip  i m thinking they all come with a nude slip  i m not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is  the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won t tear easily or to retur
itchy itchy beautiful color  design and fit   but i couldn t wait to get it off   i don t have sensitive skin and don t recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool 
horrible this looks nothing like it does on the website  it runs small and the colors are so muddy  it doesn t drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short  stiff and plain ugly  sent it back immediately 
could be cute on the right person i wanted to love this shirt  it s not my usual style buy it looked so great online  unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online  i m fair coloring   it just wasn t flattering  i m thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn t right for me  could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me 
not at all as it looks online material is awful  not soft at all  colors are much darker than shows online  it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model  it went back 
too bad i just can t get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo  mine has dark colors  really dark colors   this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide  i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large  i liked the length and the fact that it s shorter than shown  it still covered my bum   the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back  i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
another floreat top misses the mark i ve been shopping at retailer since       and floreat used to be my favorite designer  but for the past year or more  floreat mostly misses the mark  this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model       it is long on her  not so in real life  this is probably the worst part about this blouse  if it were not for this  i might try on a size m and give it another chance      it runs very large  i usually take a l or xl  i think i would need a m in this  as mentioned above      in the picture  t
so unflattering....nothing like picture i agree with the other reviewers  this top is completely disappointing in every way  i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag  where to begin          it runs really big  it s short and boxy  not at all like it appears on the model  this must be pinned a lot in this picture   colors are completely dull in person  i really think this picture was lightened a great deal   fabric feels cheap and stiff  lining is stuff and poorly sewn   i haven t one positive thing to say about t
not as pictured this dress is not flattering  the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy  like the other reviewer said  its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through  it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn t help regardless  the length is not accurate either  i would say it s a pretty short dress  mid thigh  but that probably depends on the person  it also makes you look very horizontal  i was really excited about this dress but it s getting r
a huge miss that could've been a hit what a shame this dress is  i wear xl and am       but the dress in the store in the size xs        looked just the right size  yup  xs was just the right size  i can t imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering  it would look like a sack  it is an inch or two too short in the front for me  so i ll be returning it 
how do i use my arms??? i loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on  in the dressing room area we were all laughing because  i tried on a small  when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn t raise my arms  the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches  even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren t wearing a dress at all but a shirt  too bad  poor design for sure  and such a shame when th
unflattering fit large and the material is too bulky  i returned it 
nan this dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah  i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same  not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving  would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy 
i really don't have enough bad things to say... i ll start by saying  over the years  i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer s products  this dress represents all of my frustration  cheap  cheap cheap material  low thread count  elastic    around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm  i mean  this dress is a total disaster   and looks nothing like the photograph shown 
nan i was so excited to receive this dress  i got a petite   as i am       it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible  it didn t look good on me  the waist line was a bit too high   maybe a regular would have looked better  also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn t  also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance  i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn t work for me and i had to send it back 
totally off the mark i didn t have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress  i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work  i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big  when i got the dress  i was beyond disappointed  it is a heavy  itchy polyester like fabric  not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows  it is also a deep black  not the plum color in     photos  but most importantly  i am      and the dress is very short on me  it 
fabric split apart after one day of wear i wore this blazer for one day  didn t do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam  it s completely unfixable  since it s not the seam that split but the fabric itself  what a waste of money     as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist  it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned  the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it s good over something cute     or  it would be  if it didn t fall apart 
design flaw loved the look of this shirt online  i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong  the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated  almost looks as if i m ready for take off    unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model  i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size   i would have loved it  looks great from the side but sadly i can t walk around like that   
great product, not so great fabric i love this brand  i literally live in their tops   this one is a bit of a disappointment  it is made out of fabric that feels cheap  reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products  it s very thin  and see through  unless wearing a camisole slip underneath  you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath  no muffin tops or back fat  i got the black  and am keeping it only because i love the design  need a black top desperat
beautiful colors but poor quality and bulky i was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price  it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket  the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining  in addition  the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba
nan i loved these and wore them once  i bought the red ones  and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye  ruined yet another chair    so annoyed  i loved them but they are not worth it 
comically bad these looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops      the fabric is nice and sturdy  the colors are more vibrant than online      the design however is terrible  when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren t on backwards  the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets  the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a      s circus diaper  look which is not good      they re also really tight compar
don't bother these are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not      like the description says  which is the only reason i gambled on these it is     
completely agree, not worth it the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate  but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used  although figure flattering  the zipper is so cheap that   it runs along the left side    it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress  and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they re asking for it  maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail
itchy cute  but very itchy  have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath 
nan the color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget   a very cheap polyester  on top of that   it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way   so you can bet  that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing  i ve attached a picture of the  hem  below  on top of that   the ruching is awkward  as mentioned by another reviewers   all in all   kind of terrible 
mom jeans worthy of a snl skit woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me  i felt as though it was      and i was raiding my mom s closet  the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no  it really accentuates any pouch you may have  i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering  i am            curvy  no  no  no 
for people with really long arms! i am      and the arms of this sweater run at least   inches past my finger tips  if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall  it just doesn t work  also  i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online  sigh 
awkward ruching at waist this skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away  i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching  if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband  thereby also shortening it to knee length   it would have been lovely  it should be noted that this is midi length  which is awkward on me  i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely 
nan this was a very odd fitting top  i should have read the description more closely  the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places 
wanted to love but couldn't bought this shirt on line  wanted to love it but just couldn t  i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style    just didn t have enough shape  had to send it back 
huge!! these are way oversized  i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large  wasted money on shipping  won t do that again  
nan disappointing  back is yellowish and looks strange  the front view is cute but doesn t match the fabric on the back at all  can t imagine why you would do that 
runs large and is not flattering when i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute  i love the floral detail  unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person  it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure  it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture  but it did not look good completely tucked out  i was also not a fan of the fabric  in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is  the front is more polyester and is a little dressier  but not what i envisioned  t
nan the material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful  it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area  it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward 
i wanted to love this i had my eye on this dress for months  i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store  the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures  it was very bright which disappointed me  it s also made for more busty women  at a   d i could in no way fill this dress out  the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering  i felt like an old lady in a bag 
this will not fit bustier women i so wanted to love the striped peplum top  however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top  not flattering in the least for a d dd cup  will be returning  i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen   
not a good fit i ordered this dress online  the colors are pretty  if you like pastels  and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress  for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice  for others who are not  it s just not flattering  my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me  i returned it 
wanted to love it... i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed  loved the skirt part of it  but the top  which i guess i didn t see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides  would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool 
too many pleats there were just too many pleats to this thing  it was not flattering  it looks fantastic on this model but not on me  oh well 
on the right person, maybe? this wasn t for me  i have a short neck and am       the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off  it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom  on me  this made it resemble a large bag  the neckline stood up on mine  even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar  coming up over my chin   i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft 
not cute just not cute  i don t know how else to describe this top  i am a   dd and ordered a large  it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am  i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn t in store so i returned 
beautiful dress; so excited to wear it!!! i saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it  when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes   my regular and one size larger  when i got them  i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect  beautiful pattern and material  light and airy  sexy with the low cut  keyhole   i am sooo happy with my purchase 
wanted to love it, but it's too short i was in love with this suit from the pictures  unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn t meet the bikini bottoms 
fabric felt cheap the product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap  not the quality i would expect from retailer  the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of 
love the top, but the armholes! i bought this top in black  it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back   however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short  if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for    something me  i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back 
nan the color and quality of this sweater are fantastic  the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn t seem right to me  it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck cowl  i will be returning the sweater because of that 
looks nothing like the photo very poorly made  wide and short  very unflattering  the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic 
who was the petite fit model for this? i wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp  both have gone back  i m petite and curvy   particularly on top  i wear petites     of the time  this didn t fit like a petite   it was cut like full size in every way   particularly the arm holes and length  when the mp didn t fit  i always start trying on in the larger size   i thought   well surely the small will be better  i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it  then decided that was crazy  disappoin
nothing special... this really was nothing special  for     there are much cuter tops at retailer  it wasn t particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume  it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice  i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big  overall  this was just a miss for me 
very boxy unfortunately this one is going back  the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back 
pajama jeans i love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not so skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great  but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft    too soft    and bag out in the first   minutes  the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering  maybe if you re looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats 
really wanted to like it looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try  the material seems cheap and stiff  would not fit my frame well 
photos on model misleading the concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice  the inner layer is sheer but as long as you re wearing a nude colored bra  no big deal  however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy  they must ve photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top  because it looks like it hangs straight on her  i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package  it clearly flares out   is a line  so as a previous reviewer stated  it looks huge from the front  if it had fit the
polyester! urrrrgh dear retailer   designers   just want a nice dress that isn t made from polyester  don t mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics  but please  enough of the polyester    love   your customers
cute but a bit too long i bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide  i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online  the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model  i am      tall and weigh     lbs  i believe the petite would have been a much better fit  i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available 
i was disappointed. the sweater material was fragile  there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived  i felt like it would not wear or wash well  i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body  i am returning the sweater 
snags easily i was very disappointed in the quality of this top  the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front  i had to pull the thread under so it wasn t exposed  i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine  this top is extremely delicate and doesn t withstand normal everyday casual wear although it s s casual lightweight sweater  now it s just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt 
buyer beware- stretches out significantly! i am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with  my recent preference has been for high rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash  when i tried these on in my normal size  they were so cute that i bought them full priced  i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy  which is what makes them soft and comfortable   but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours  by th
nan i really liked the casual style of this top  but i was disappointed when i put it on   it s cut weird  the shoulder cut outs are smaller than pictured and just don t seem to hang right   they don t hit where they re supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured  more like     which i didn t like   the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off   i tried xs and s   both fit weird 
too flare too small    too flare    nice thick fabric  not my favorite pant 
underwhelming i was really disappointed with these pants  they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch  they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist  sadly  they will be going back 
not quite cinderella i thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build  instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected  i felt dowdy in it 
a formal yoga pant the other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a    petite  i am      and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered  the length was not what made me send them back though  the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made  however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material  if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great
lost in translation i loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly  it makes me look like a football player  i am         athletic build and i was swimming in the m  i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads  it hangs and gaps awkwardly  the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short 
runs at least 2 sizes small these run at least   sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand  mother  such a bummer because the quality is totally on point  i m going to exchange them for a huge size i guess  whatever  i don t mind having a size that s so much larger than all my other jeans  i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process  i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control  it s not retailer s fault  so annoyed 
lovely blouse the the v is far too deep the fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful  but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look  i have a large chest  but the similarly cut blouse  without the textured fabric   from the same designer  fit me fine  this one is just cut differently  i even tried sizing up and down   to no avail  the photo on the model seems misleading because i don t see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone   even with a smaller chest  i was so
love the style, however was a disappointment i usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small  i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit  pretty but returning 
super cute on, colors completely faded love this dress  wore it last night for a musical event    came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water   just as the label states  pulled the dress out and guess what  the design is completely faded    it looks   years old    so sad  i m going to call retailer and ask for a refund  i live two hours away 
nan while the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller  the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model  it rides up under your boobs  and the whole cup area tips forward   it s not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert  immediately went back  hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they ll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they re also workable for fuller cup sizes  underwire please  
nan this sweater was not as featured in the picture  the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length  the front barely reached the middle of my stomach  also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture  this sweater will be going back 
didn't work for me seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design  perhaps it was just too big  returned it 
nan i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan  unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach  the chest fit well   though it was very low cut   but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger   the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long 
not for me this dress is absolutely hideous on my physique  ordered a size   and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent  i have an athletic built am a   d  it is going back asap 
sad sack well   this is  on me  as i saw this hanging in the store  but way off on my size which is xxs petite     i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me     both pieces are transparent   no opaque lining at all is inside  both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials  there is no  flow   just cling  the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape     this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece   at all  bes
beautiful top ruined by styling this top is beautiful   even more so in person  however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy  there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can t see in the photos due to the model s cardigan and arms  if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect  again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous  would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
nan this nightgown looked so comfy and cute  i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight i m      and    lbs  it was such a shame  size large should not just be really a medium 
nan i have to agree with the first reviewer  i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn t justify it for the price  i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn t get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes      i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews
not lined and low quality silk... disappointed! the cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined  although the color is beautiful  the cheap fabric has no variation  is too saturated  and lacks any sheen of quality silk    shocked at the price  i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre        being back the quality 
not if you're busty i am a   dd        and    lbs and this top was way too baggy  it looked awful  this is shapeless and oversized  i would size down or just pass 
underwhelming fabric felt and looked cheap   hem was completely frayed  all the way around  perhaps purposely  but ratty looking  all the same 
nan looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area  total disappointment  i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side 
fits weird i m          lbs and ordered an xs petite  i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well  but this one was weirdly big at the top
disappointed i though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve  it s not  first of all  it runs very large  i purchased a small  i am usually a xs or small in maeve  i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress   the shoulders were very wide  you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn t lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest  and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless  i really wanted this dress to work  i love
disappointing i had been looking at this dress on line hoping for a pop back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size  i found the colors and print a bit blah  i felt like it could use a little detail for the price   bead detail or embroidery  in real life and i didn t love the fabric  in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn t drape particularly well  things got worse in the dressing room   it was a disaster on me  i m busty and while the top fit  because
fit is nothing like the photo i was so excited to purchase this dress  i love all shades of grey for winter clothing  i love knits  and i have loved other maeve dresses  however  i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed  it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model  to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress   for reference  i am       slender and small boned but also curvy  hourglass   my bust is    c  hips about        i normally wear a small in maeve dresses  maybe it s j
too much fabric...horrible design love the print and was looking forward to this dress  the length and bust are just right in normal sizing  however the  swing  effect is all off  there s so much fabric  its like wearing a moo moo  not at all flattering  disappointed in this one 
nan i wanted to love this dress  the material is beautiful  but sadly i agree with other reviewer  the model definitely has this pinned back  i am on the small side            lbs  straight figure  very tiny  girls   and this dress looked awful  totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back  the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly  as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great  xs ordered and length was good but wish the  swin
preggers i really wanted to love this dress  i love the colors and the design of the dress  unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant  it s so voluminous that it s not flattering at all  also agree that the lining is scratchy 
just ok material cheap  too small  good idea for design  love princess cut but bad material  good idea though  sending back
cozy wrap sweatshirt first of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee  i don t know why they do that     you re not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it s cheap  second  i m usually a     in retailer and mine is no where near as loose fitting as the photo  also  he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit    like a flimsy t shirt  and see thru  the sleeves form fit to my arms so i couldn t layer under it  but i couldn t wear it alone with the fa
loved the blouse but it runs super small  i wear a medium for everything but couldn t come close to buttoning this  the buttons were about   inches apart  horizontally   probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit  the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires  truth in sizing 
not like the old pilcro i am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size     i don t have stick legs  and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together  with the old pilcro material  this did not happen  this is a super soft jean  and although the fit was good  they just didn t last 
nan where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go    these are a cheap impersonator  the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half  the last   pairs of pilcro stets i ve ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally  the pockets on these jeans sit so so low  completely unflattering  the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially  the old stet ankle jeans ha
they are tapered! why?! waist is tight and thighs and legs are not   not flattering  ankle opening is too small  and they have a funny smell 
strange fit for a couple weeks  i debated making this purchase  in fear that my size would no longer be available  i ordered this lovely top  when it arrived  i was immediately disappointed with its colors   unlike the vibrant colors in the photo  the top s colors were dull   more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender  had the fit been better  i would have kept this item despite of its color  it s cut weird  though it runs slightly large  i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
sleeves destroy this beautiful blouse this is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse  which i also ordered  it s extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse  it added    pounds  the print is beautiful  the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail  i ordered size large and am well endowed  steer clear if you have a bust 
did not look good on me this is a beautiful dress  the quality is excellent  the   layers and the embroidery are beautiful    however it just didn t look right on me  it looked like a maternity dress  i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me  i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust  unfortunately i will be returning this dress 
nan i had high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress  it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist  it s so odd 
does not look good in person- strawberry shortcake this dress looks amazing on line  in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out  and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake  too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering  pattern is dizzying in person      very thin multi layer dress  should be better material and quality for this price  save your money and shipping 
super pretty - not sure how to wear the front cream panel is completely transparent i didn t purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath   i wish the fabric were translucent   not so see through 
rediculously small this top is beautiful online and in person  i am in no way a large full figured gal  but i did order an xl  reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size  this shirt is horribly tiny in person  the xl regular fit looked like an xs  have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what  will take back  other than fit  the shirt is very beautiful in every way 
rather cheap looking cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it  if you look really close in the photo you can see it 
too much like jodphurs! good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings  it s hard to see where i would wear them     sorry but they have to go back 
beautiful design, way too large i love almost all tops from retailer  however this one was just enormous  it is beautifully designed  but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn t believe it was sized    i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size   tag on an xl shirt  for reference  i am      and    lbs  i would have loved this shirt if it hadn t been so big 
stretched out upon receipt i opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on  the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees  someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them  they were obviously too small for whoever did that  these never should have been resent to another customer  they are obviously very misshapen  they are going back  on a bet
buttondown on the hanger i thought this had a chance  but oh geez    puffy sleeves  itchy  metallic thread  lace    what a mess  and thin  and uncomfortable  no  no  no 
too wide and short i ordered this in white and it s quite sheer  as others have noted  it is really full and it hits at mid hip which doesn t work on my figure  if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic  or less voluminous  it could have worked but nope 
wanted to love it the colors in this dress are beautiful  the green blue version  but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy  i purchased it online and wasn t expecting it to be so sheer    the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown  i really wanted to love it but it s going back 
nan this is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it 
boxy i wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun  but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline
house dress this is much prettier online than on me  too much dress  even though i sized down 
fina tie tunic i was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product  as soon as i put this tunic  the right tie loop detached from the garment  i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store  the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product 
not what you think this skirt looks cute online but  it has several issues      the slit is very high  this photo is deceptive  look closely   the slit is actually to her finger tips  you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights      slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away      the micro mini  slip  bunches      the fine knit is very snag able      the skirt is very long  it is going back 
not as pictured i just received this dress wadded up in a bag  it is nothing like the colors shown on line  in the picture it appears blue and white  in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink  the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt  will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn t try to buy a dress on line 
huge and very unflattering this top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure  i have   ddd boobs and a muscular  curvy frame  this top adds about   lbs 
disappointed bummed out   this is super cheaply made and very expensive    the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story   it should be priced at the most    bucks   not       i m returning them  also  they run very big   
large it runs large  loose or oversized tops don t bother me so i thought it would be fine  but this just made me look wider then i am  is thin and too sheer for me as well  it was just so unflattering  i had to return it 
tent this item is huge  i m normally a medium  sized down to a small  still massive  couldn t go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest  but the sleeves are very wide  as is the waist  way too much fabric  i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn t work  for reference i love billowy and flowy tops  but this was a tent 
very bulky at the bottom i love the color of this top but the style is not flattering  i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive  i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide  bummer
way too big i loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me  i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn t flattering at all  i even went down one size and it still was huge  sad to send this one back 
tight sleeves seems there was a design defect in this item  sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt  i have pretty thin arms so it s hard to imagine this not happening on anyone  too bad because it s otherwise a very nice top 
ugh... no this dress is great if you re very skinny and have no chest  otherwise  it makes you look dowdy  the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion     this one is going back 
fools you! ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear  this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs  hard to walk in it  the material felt kind of cheap to me  i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn t like it at all  it went back 
not worth the money i love the idea of this top and ordered it in white  it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans  the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel  i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking  if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made  then it would have been a winner 
only for no chested women this is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed   it is extremely well fitted in the chest  the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining  a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction  also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric  i am normally a     at retailer and the   was extremely small 
perfect maternity top! could not wait for this to come and so disappointed   first of all  it s not a happy orange  it a darker rust   second  it is huge   fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top   you could go to term in this blouse   back it goes   so sad 
beautiful but thin material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once     got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it s a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits 
nan this is a beautiful kimono but just isn t made well  the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable  after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good  such a shame 
dress is fabulous but...... i loved this dress and the color  i wanted to wear it to my niece s wedding  i usually wear a medium but couldn t get it on  the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks  the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn t cut  but the top was huge  i really don t understand the sizing of this dress at all 
not a kimono. this is not a kimono  it s a cocoon  there s a huge difference   it s also not made very well 
fits weird i wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird  slender in arms but baggy in the torso  i will be returning
wish it were made out of cotton it s sheer  the design  print is casual  but on silk like material  had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it  who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer   
nan was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size  i am either a large or xl  i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size  first  the top is huge  i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely  the rest of the top was like a large tent  the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking  in fact  in the store  it was displayed with a jacket over it  online  the orange looks completely different 
piece didn't make sense this piece didn t make sense to me   maybe it s bc i m a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer   i didn t think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear   it went back 
too small this shirt is so small  i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit  don t waste your time on this shirt  such a shame  it could have been very cute 
great idea, poor execution pretty color  but i was hoping for a thicker  higher quality material for the price  the material is lightweight and isn t tailored well  looks kind of sloppy 
gigantic i ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest  even then  the vest looked like a large  not only was it incredibly loose   much looser than in looks in the picture   but the arm holes were huge too  it just looked too big  not artfully drapey 
oversized tshirt i really wanted to like this    it s soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that s where the positives end  i ordered the xs and it was huge  wide  shapeless  and way too long  i m    lbs and       even if it came in petite  i m not sure it s worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out 
runs too small i bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small  i could not even pull the skirt all the way up  returned
thin and no longer the same ag quality these ag stevie ankle jeans only have     cotton tthe rest is     lyocell  a rayon      polyester  and    polyurethane  result  thin and clingy jeans that show every lump  and stretch out       these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at     cotton      modal     pu  it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with     cotton  at least in the stevies      i m sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs  b
boxy i try to find something to like about everything i buy  even if it turns out to be a disappointment  for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering  it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt  but unfortunately it was not enough  this shirt is super boxy and runs large  i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this  if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won t pull at the ch
cheaply made i had loved this on line when i saw the pretty floral pattern  however  in person  it is such a disappointment  the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor 
flower sack this dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on  even the sz   was too loose and shapeless  there is no waist as pictured  the hi low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam  see in the third close up picture  make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash  it s really too bad  it s such a pretty combination of patterns 
nan i should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy  but i didn t believe them and bought it anyway  i was wrong  this top is so boxy and wide  just awful 
loose and unflattering i m normally a small in retailer tops  i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper  more fitted  part  it all went horribly wrong from there  the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good    pounds to my frame  this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality 
nan very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big  returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium  it was apparently not available in the medium  i was charged a      fee for return shopping  so i immediately went to website  medium available and i had to pay another       for shipping  seems a bit unreasonable  but really liked the dress 
wanted to love! the quality and fabric are fabulous but it s just too voluminous for my figure            lbs   would look great on someone more slender 
sending this one back the photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall spring cardigan  when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no  shimmer  as far as i can tell  i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn t work  it looks too rumpled and i don t want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed 
great price (on sale) but sheds too much! loved the sweater and the sale price was great  but i could not take the shedding  even after just trying it on the first time  my jeans and top had shedding all over them  this was   minutes  i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day  had to return 
gorgeous but sheds horribly this sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing     it sheds everywhere  i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and    large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you  if you like dark jeans  don t purchase  before i walked out of the store  the salesperson had to use a delineator on me  it was hysterical  sheds so much
nan purchased this item on sale received it and it had two huge holes on the side not possible to repair  very disappointed in lack of quality control    
fell short of expectations i had high hopes for this top but sadly it was not meant to be  it was tts  i m     and usually wear a small   but the material was horribly scratchy  both the body of the top as well as the sleeves  and the design isn t all that flattering  it made me look really wide at the bottom and i definitely am not in real life 
wish it was like the picture! i anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful  i opened it  tried it on  sent it back   it is well made but has too many negatives  first  it is very thick  i ordered size              lbs    the size was good  but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen  it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way  finally  and most importantly  it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c
really wanted to like it the sides scooped up a bit too much on me  i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work  but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff  back it goes    
disappointing maybe it s because i m     but this top was underwhelming  i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big  obnoxious bow on the back  it does look cute on the model  so maybe it s a  younger  top  i would have felt silly wearing it 
weird color not flattering and not the color it appears online  this is really a pink shirt 
terrible pattern placement of flowers on chest i ordered this top based on the photos  this looked unique and beautiful  plus i ve loved past designs by this brand  i thought this would be nice for summer  there isn t a straight on view of the front of the top for a reason  the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest  away from the border of the rest of the flowers  the flower looks kind of like a bee  i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem 
retro i have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer  now the dresses are just retro funky  sad to see 
the brown/gray version is cropped the photos don t look it  but the one i received was a cropped length  the bottom of the sweater s longest parts didn t even reach the top of my mid rise pants  and i m      so it wasn t that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are    tall      disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this 
different from picture what a pity  this blouse has a beautiful design  however it doesn t fit well on the body  it s not really a size problem  it s just not a well fitted blouse  the color is very deceptive  it looks white on the picture  but it s actually pink  i m probably going to return it 
no shape this jacket has cute details  i like the front pockets and color  it has no shape and is about   size bigger than marked  i felt like a sack of potatoes in it 
nope ugh  i was so disappointed with this shirt  i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print  unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don t have a straight on photo of the shirt  its very plain and lays very unflatteringly  it s definitely missing something in the front  i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn t returned i
print ? the print doesn t necessarily works for everybody 
short but wide this is a crop top but super boxy and wide  i expected it to be more fitted in the waist  since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering  i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me  too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i m willing to pay full price for something that works 
nan although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well  it really did not lay right on me  i m a   d  and i got my usual size in a small  the arm holes were a bit too big  the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me 
awkward fit i was so excited to try these on at my local retailer  i m so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off  the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward  they were also not as soft as i expected them to be 
poor design if you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right  it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest  it literally runs right through the center of the breasts  what were they thinking  if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect  for reference  i m approximately    lb and have a dd cup 
bad fit and bad construction the fit is so bad and the construction is very poor  i m            lbs  ordered xxs petite      first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on  the vest runs narrow  yet tall it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse     the  skirt  at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market  it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin  it did not meet as closely in the middl
:( terrible fit looked good in pictures  i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge  although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful  it is very awkward and poor fit  will be sending back 
nan the top is cute  but when i received it  it did not feel like cotton  the tag says      viscose  i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future  on the plus side  the return was no problem 
buttons broke before i even got it on! i m so disappointed  the dress looked lovely in the box  but when i started to unbutton it to try it on  two buttons split in half  it s going right back 
the peplum hit me very high on my torso the peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage  not at my natural waist  so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up  i am busty so it s possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem  i was disappointed to return it  the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one 
gorgeous dress, but.... i ordered this dress in a size    my normal size at retailer  it is a lovely dress and so feminine  but it is incorrectly sized  i couldn t begin to button it  i reordered it in size    if that tells you anything  buyer beware  unless you are itsy bitsy  you need to size up  i will say that as pretty as the photos are  the dress is even more lovely in person 
cute but not right for me i really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me    made my curvy body look shapeless   also had a button crack before i even put it on   returned it 
little house on the prairie top really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type  also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me 
nan i was so excited to get these  i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large   sadly they did not fit  i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case  i m very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size  they are super cute from someone skinny 
nan as soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging  i feel in love with them  the fabric was so soft   i could not wait to get them on   yeah  that was not going to happen  i could not pull them on   not even a little bit  these pants run incredibly small  i ordered them twice  once in my regular size  and again in a larger size  unfortunately  i am sized out of these beauties 
wish they worked the design and quality were great  i really wanted them to fit but they ran large  i m     and     lbs and orderd the small  unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won t be trying a size down  the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward  sadly these went back 
very cute, but runs small and buttons break i saw this dress online  and i thought it was perfectly cute  however  once i tried it on at home  it just didn t work  one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning  and once i got it on  the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm   i m       and      lbs and purchased in size     i didn t even try buttoning all the way  i took it back  and i don t even think i want a larger size  the buttons are just too fragile 
nan although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give  one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it  unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave  it just misses the mark and will be going back 
pretty but heavy, buttonholes too small really like this dress but       the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress  worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes   impossible   has to go back
not flattering! i put on this t shirt and my husband said it makes you look old  he was right  i m not sure if it s the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too  perhaps on someone else it would look different  the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking  it may look better on someone taller 
nan one of the worst shirts i ve tried in a long time  i don t know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model  in person it is sleeveless  huge  short and wide 
nan i tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful  i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments  when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost   size  the pant legs were high water  i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn t budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material  to my disappointment  i returned it  i really wished it would have worked out 
well made; but huge the fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made  unfortunately  the fit was enormous  i ve an athletic build w  big boobs   normally wear l in retailer tops 
too low-cut the pattern and colors are very pretty  and the material is soft and silky  i returned it  though  because it is very low cut in the front  it comes down to between my breasts  which is not going to work for me 
cute pattern but design wasn't flattering i was really excited to get this top in the mail  unlike other reviewers  i didn t find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn t look good with the billow y torso of the top  i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i m very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn t look as good on me 
awesome print but horrible fit! i own two poodles and love anything poodle print  i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale  but it is horrible  the fit is like wearing a pillowcase  it was about   inches too wide on each side while the arms fit  it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong  i was in love with the print however i had to return it 
nan this is more of an undershirt than a shirt  the material is very very thin and it shows everything  it was beyond unflattering on me  don t buy this unless you have a knockout thin body 
not great the shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering  my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn t as cute as online  returning this one 
didn't work! i saw this very shirt online   thought it was so pretty  in person  the shirt seems flimsy  the buttons look as though they d fall off  i also didn t like the cut of the shirt  it seemed to be tighter on top   looser on the bottom  had to return  i couldn t justify the cost with the quality 
cute pattern but weird fit i was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack  i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom  it was not flattering at all  i d love to see this pattern back with a better fit 
nan horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath
didn't meet my expectations the dress didn t meet my expectations  specifically the color  the texture  and the cut of the dress  although the dress was very well made  it just wasn t right for me 
way too big i usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly  this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn t  i m     and i ordered a petite small  i was swimming in it  the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants  i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me 
spandex, not tweed dress i was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed  not the same colors as the picture  spandex material  the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped  i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress 
disappointed these leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there   i am returning the item 
extra sleeves? cute enough  but i couldn t figure out what to do with the tie that didn t make it look like an extra set of sleeves  oddly placed 
goofy skirt on this dress. this dress has pretty colors  the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella  it has enough material to make   skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways  the photo of model is from side  not the front  very unflattering on me 
color not as pictured i returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo  i did not like the color 
wanted to love it unfortunately  this sweater let me down  i love retailer  especially their sweaters  but this one fell flat  it was tight on the arms  and didn t hang well on my body  it was odd in length and added about   lb to my frame  i kept it because i wanted to force it to work  alas  i just donated it  hopefully it fits someone else better than me  
nan this top was originally way overpriced  so i ordered it on sale for half price  still overpriced  it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed  the quality is not great  it is like a jersey type material  doesn t look like the photograph at all  i like the color  but frankly  that s about it 
sent straight back i ordered this top online during the mother s day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer  i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back  the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good  but the problem is that the top comes with an under layer up top  this is normally a good thing  extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless  the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
runs big pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom  fit my chest alright    c  but flared out way too much at the bottom 
material too flimsy i wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns  however  when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn t appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected  could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin   also  i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am  i am a   ddd and i normally where a size medium  a medium fit but like i said made
cheap fabric and terrible fit i bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit  the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size     beware  i have a   d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers  it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses  in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the    s  it was a thick polyester type material  i think this shirt would still work f
nice fit. this is a very slimming  well made  nice fitting top i just disliked the colors  they did not look good on me  otherwise this is a very nice piece 
not the same! i usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand  they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body  this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size   rather than my normal size    i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes     and    because they didn t label them         etc  anymore  these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever   the    s
so disappointing! i was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package  the fabric is extremely stiff and thin  the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through  the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders  therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children s clothing  i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn t even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
too boxy but nice idea this dress did not work well on my figure  i have a small waist and broad hips  and the dress  size m for     lbs        was too boxy  i didn t have objections to the fabric  like other reviewers   honestly  even if there were a snag or two  the fabric is kind of rustic and i don t think a snag would look terrible  depending on where it is  i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival  my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f
big blue sack this dress hangs like a sack  it really needs a belt to give it some shape  i tried to style it with one  but then didn t look right either  i did like the slip that came with it  i ll be returning it 
nothing like the picture! i thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt  not at all  i m either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight  it is more fitted  if you are looking for something more comfy  don t buy  however  if you want more of a fitted blouse feel  then go for it 
not as expected i really loved the colors and style of this top  unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me  i m      some mentioned they didn t like fabric but i thought it was good 
petite and busty- avoid i wanted to like this so much  it s a great good girl dress  church dress  however  it makes no sense  it s a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i m petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide 
not worth the money i did not like this cashmere sweater at all  i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color  although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking   it was also very short   not worth the money even at     off 
runs really large i really liked the design  ordered a medium which was huge  also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material    a bit itchy  returned it 
beautiful print i loved this dress before putting it on  but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type  it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for  sadly this will be going back  i loved the print and the feel of the material  just not a flattering cut for me 
an immediate return the fit on this shirt is bizarre  it very much resembles a nursing top  but wouldn t actually work for that purpose   the side visible in the picture is nicely draped  but the other side can flap open and is completely different  i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate 
see through and strange i own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance  i was hoping these would be the same  i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front  i have no desire to have a bra sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric  it is tacky 
bunches up... i saw this on sale  and it looked lovely online  i really wanted to love it when i received it  it looked great  but once i tried it on  it bunches up in the back  it looks awkward  the lace and small details are pretty  but the fit is just off  returned it in the store 
too wide this would have been cute if it was more fitted  i am     and     lbs and the small was too wide  i didn t try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length 
it's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering it s like a work of art  but sadly  not flattering on me  i absolutely loved the look  and even considered taking it to a tailor  but the material overall is very stiff  if you re teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips  you might love it  very sad to return this 
a few problems these are very pretty  but i have had a few problems with them  out of the package  i found them to be true to size  i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs  however  even though they are machine washable  i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short  i am barely over    tall   also  the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing  which drives me crazy  i have to keep straightening it  i think there are better options for sleep pants 
nan i was so excited about this top  and so disappointed when it arrived today  the lace part is lovely  but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides  it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated  and there is no way to get it to lay flat  the back center section is pleated  why couldn t they have had the pleats all around  this will be going back with much regret 
fly away sides i waited a long time to get this top  unfortunately i will be returning  the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides  not as pictured  the sides should have been pleated  it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug  afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing  the design is unique and wish this top would of worked 
not what i expected it was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height  the pull on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening  i was afraid it might rip a seam  the fabric seems low quality  like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others  overall  not the dress or quality i expected   
pretty bad in real life when i unwrapped this a chemical  stink  hit me that amost knocked me over  it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells  second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut  the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner  i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here  with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out  i do not recommend this fo
nan very cute dress  but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn t be pressed out 
not for petites length too long and waist to high  these are not sized for petites 
not recommended if petite i disliked this dress  it didn t fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured  i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest  i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time  not recommended for petite women 
the pants are see-through i can t stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric  i don t consider that high quality 
depends on body type i think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type  just not mine  i m          and a   ddd a couple weeks post partum  thought this could be a good shirt while i m nursing bc it s flowy but stylish  unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on  the cut drew all attention to my big chest   not in a good way  and distracted from my smaller lower half  made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am  probably good for small chested girls  very tall girls or curvy on the
very see through i ordered this shirt online and didn t even try it on    it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don t want to have that extra layer in the summer   it is cute though 
april fools? i do not even know where to begin with this product  i ordered a small  i go between small and medium  and felt that would be a good fit  after trying on the shirt  i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is  this shirt is very boxy  i know its supposed to have a  flow  to it  but this shirt is too much  it needs to be taken in  or have a belt wrapped around it  i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering  i found this color to be very blah  overall  i am slig
nan huge  normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering 
had such promise i was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews  the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true  i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out  in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v neck in front dipped a little lower  too  a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn t bother  i returned it to the store 
be careful how you wash! this shirt is beautiful  it is flowy and light  a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring  however  do not follow the washing instructions on the tag  it says you can machine wash  tumble dry low  and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low  it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it  it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again  if you do order  please take the
love it, but..... i love this top  so cute and comfy    but i wore it twice  washed it once on gentle and layed to dry     now there are   small holes in the front  for as much as it cost  i would have expected it to be more durable  very disappointing  especially since i don t live near an retailer and can t take it back easily      
too boxy i have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was     off  i ordered a size m petite  sadly when it arrived and i tried it on  it was very boxy  stiff like  and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back 
huge runs very large  ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
cute idea horrible fit this was exactly the item i was looking for  simple  black  stylish   unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off   the upper arms  chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering 
nan i second that above review who states  worst blouse i ve ever ordered 
shapeless and itchy sweater i ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall  in order to see which was the best fit  i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online   like it had a nice flow  the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have  i was really disappointed  the sweater doesn t flow like it does in the picture   it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn t flattering  i have a small build  and  frankly  i usually look good in sweaters
color not as pictured on website i wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it  she was absolutely right   the color is completely different in person  it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn  it s too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch  maybe the blue is better in person   
worst blouse i've ordered....ever :( there were no reviews  it s an  online exclusive  and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding  the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material  on the white version of this  it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful  as a busty   d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium  it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out  i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph  i m an anth
overwhelmed me i am petite       even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me  i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace  it made it look cheap  i wanted this to be the perfect lbd  i  just couldn t make it work on my body 
beautiful dress, fits horribly i purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer s recent     off sale  i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night  they both seemed to be just what i was looking for  i ordered a   regular and a   regular  as i am usually in between sizes  the   was definitely too small  the   fit  technically  but was very ill fitting  not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short waisted  i am only       but it fe
nan this top is beautifully made and designed  material is soft and comfortable however it s very boxy  the details on the side stick out  i just found it not very flattering for me 
cool tank, but may need courage to wear. i tried wearing it  however  i thought i needed courage to wear this tank   unfortunately  i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design   first  it runs small than the regular size    it feels even smaller because my size is xs   in addition  it tends to exaggerate a body line   i am not quite sure why this happens  but maybe it is just the way this tank is   if you are confident about your upper body posture  then yes  it would look very cool   however  if you have thin postur
nan when i saw this item online  i ordered it right away  loved the color and the oversized  comfy look to it  the pros  very soft the color a deep cranberry as pictured  the cons  the low back   in the photo  the model s arms cover it up  when i put it on  it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front    and because the material is unstructured  that made it look worse  i loved it except for this one feature  but because it was so detracting  i had
can't be worn as pictured ah  i wanted to love this but without anything under it  as pictured   the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob  i am      and a small b cup  i ordered an xs petite  it fits but there isn t enough material under the armpits  the fabric and design is great other than this flaw  sadly returning 
runs a bit large and hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous  i think how it fits depends alot on body type  the material is nice  color pretty  not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine     
too many ideas i was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn t my first choice  that was the least of the problems with this jacket  i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem  the sum of the parts didn t work  though  the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess  the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
nan i really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn t  it ran large and heavy  rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on  there was one upside  the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture 
very thin fabric, not worth $90 the pants are pretty and run true to size  but the fabric is bathing suit like  very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat  i wouldn t recommend for anything but waking 
thin material i wanted so badly to love this dress  but i couldn t get past the thin material that you can actually see through  not for this price anyhow  the dress is shorter than i had anticipated  and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn t accurately portrayed in the photo  on the positive though  the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning  but alas will be returning 
a total dud was really excited for this dress and couldn t be more disappointed  doesn t look anything like the pictures     the fabric feels   cheap  it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess      looking beyond that  i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly  unfortunately not  the top half doesn t sit correctly  it s so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design  it doesn t sit on your shoulders  but doesn t look right off your shoulders  the neckline is very high  also  front b
disappointed i was really looking forward to this dress  i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture  it came wrinkled  but i think even pressed it would fall weird  the side swoop falls funny  and you can see the seams underneath  and the top front falls funny  not quite sure what to do with it  it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down  again  maybe if you get it pressed that would be better  the back is still beautiful though  i m         lbs ordered a     maybe on someone talle
beautiful suede, but colors are not correct. just received these and they fit perfectly  but the panels are different shades of gray  the color is not consistent and it make them look bad  they are perfect otherwise  but sadly they are not wearable  i will be returning
not great in person... i was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online  however  i was very disappointed when i finally received it  the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person  i could almost get over the sleeves  but the white part of the shirt was horrible  i am      and a size    i wear a size small at retailer  and i got a small in this top  the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line   which i
runs small would be a bit of an understatement... it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion  i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly   this does not run small this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women s apparel sizing  i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me very small
10 lbs. no thanks! i was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo  however  upon arrival i was completely disappointed  the color is much more drab than the photo  the smudged polkadots weren t attractive  there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen  the dress is super heavy  the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly  and it adds    pounds to your hips  super sad  i am sending it back 
scooped knit slip doesn t feel like cotton jersey  feels like a thin version of the seamless cami  it s not soft as i expected  it s much thinner than expected too 
very cute but will shrink! i loved this shirt  flattering and pretty  it s hand wash only or dry clean  i hand washed it and the blue t shirt part of the shirt shrank  and now the front of the shirt is too short for me  would not recommend due to shrinkage    too bad 
a disappointment this dress is just very unattractive  it is quite short waisted  almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place  also it is very long   midi length   and the skirt is very wide  the effect is matronly  not cute at all  size wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good 
it's going back this tank  in black  is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well  it s just too short and too boxy for my figure  curvy hips   would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted  since that doesn t describe me  it has to go back 
great idea, but... every single time i was in a store  this dress caught my eye  there was never a large or xl to try on  however  so when a free shipping offer came up  i took a chance and ordered both  the xl was too large  the large was much better  but a little snug  so if it shrunk  i would have been out of luck  if i would have kept one  it would have been the large  however  they are both going back  a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger  but on a body  it is
ill fitting like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress s fit  the dress doesn t fit right around the bust or the waist  as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn t have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size  this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right  while a belt helps  i don t think it helps enough to justify the price  it s too bad  i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea
too boxy, sizing down - not good! i read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn t think it would be a terribly big deal  unfortunately  it is  normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs  the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short  unfortunately  this is going back  not a good fit  adorable details but the fit is terrible 
great design, poor execution i was really excited about this dress  i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece  casual or dress up  when it arrived in the mail  the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress  unfortunately it hung like that  too  the material sags in places it shouldn t  i have a          lb frame  and i ordered an extra small  and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back
wanted to love it i thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod  this one didn t work for me  i ordered the medium  the top is very small  i would recommend only for b cup or smaller  the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape  it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter  sending this one back  i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit 
beware the butt sag. these pants are the perfect color  and i love the detail of the zippered pockets    i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well  they were slightly loose  but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small  after an hour of wear  i was swimming in these  i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly  um  saggy  i am in between a   and    and since the pants are detailed as slim fit  i thought it
arrived damaged the button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled  will be returning    
big and boxt i ordered a small  but it was way to big  it was very soft 
stretches & creases like crazy these were so perfect for the first hour or so  i was convinced they were my new favorite pants  but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i d been sitting a couple hours  it looked downright embarrassing   saggy and wrinkly  radiating from the crotch  no less    i got them in the gray  and it s possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric 
wanted to like it i have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago   i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress    the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it s the color that killed it for me    i ordered the  orange  because i liked the photo on the model   when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on    the color is almost neon orange    too much for this redhead   hard to wear that bright neony color   not sure
hooded utility cape this was completely different than i expected  the xs s was so large that it looked messy  unfortunately i had to return it 
had to return i loved this dress and it fit perfectly  i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight  and i am really curvy  i did however have a problem trying to take it off  it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back  i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too  i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn t  maybe it was me  but this dress is too much hassle  if i went any highe
dissappointed in this blouse when i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print  i was so disappointed when it came  the print is not centered in the front or the back  it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry  for this price the detail of centering the design was expected  especially because this is how it appeared in the picture  loved the blouse  but i will be returning it becau
nan as the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap  i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp  i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back 
nan the skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip  even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through  the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt  if it wasn t see through i would keep it 
little doll on the prarie loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie 
nan horrible fit  i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress 
where is the slip!? was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale  the colors are great and it fits pretty good  but it came without a slip    so disappointing to not receive the entire dress    hence the   stars  may send it back for this reason 
too billowy i really loved this in the catalog  the fabric and details are very pretty  however it s a lot of fabric without much form  my husband suggested it for maternity  not realizing it has fitted slip   not for curvy  hourglass   had to send it back 
very roomy i ordered this dress is in the yellow orange  the colors are pretty  the pink detail is nice and that s about it  the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton   no big deal  the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way  if i was pregnant  it was perfect  the material feels cheap to me and this  along with the roomy fit   is why this dress will be returned 
nan this is a beautiful dress  however  it looked awful on me  i ordered the medium and it was huge  also  i looked   months pregnant  not a good style for the short person 
make sure you handwash or dry clean only luckily i bought this on sale    i now see the instructions online say to hand wash  but i bought mine in the store  the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry  i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size 
maternity blouse i was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse  not flattering at all  i loved the concept   silky  loose fitting  professional   but they didn t succeed  its a big mess  return 
great vintage pattern but what were they thinking oh such a classic retailer look for summer  a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric  i was immediately drawn to it  but wait  there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist  creating the look of an apron  yes  it looks like one is wearing a full apron  or scrub dress    why   this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt blouse combo 
more cons than pros the material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves  i would buy in a minute  we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining  now the cons  i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look  it runs short and i can t imagine who thought this design was a good idea  there were no reviews when i ordered  i am learning to try it on in the store and or read the reviews before investing  i would say go up a
pretty print, strange fit totally bummed  the pretty print doesn t outweigh the very odd fit of this dress  makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person  sadly  went right back 
disappointing i really liked this dress in pictures online  i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays  everything about this dress was a disappointment  especially at this price point  the fit was weird  tight in some places  too loose in others  i m usually xs or s  i ordered this one is s   it s made out of a fairly thick and warm material  yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures  especially in the back  making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck  upper b
runs way too big i really wanted to love this piece but it was very large  i m     and ordered xs s and i have return due to size 
80's sweater remember those cable knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties   that s exactly what this sweater is  everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere  i ll pass on this 
runs big, a bit sloppy looking and overpriced. i was thoroughly underwhelmed  it did not hang well  and the fit seemed off  the tie waist just sort of hung there  i could have sized down  but i didn t even want to bother  it was pretty boring and flimsy for      
odd sleeves the design of this sweater is odd  it made me feel very  round  when i put it on  the sleeves were wide  the other reviewers were correct in saying that it s a thick sweater  which i thought i d like  the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected  it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater 
couldn't get it to work! after reading every review  i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress  wrong  i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage  the top is very exposing of the bust  and i m small busted  i can t stand wearing camis  so there no way i d be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large  for reference  i m       a straight build     lbs  and wear a    pluses on this dress are  i loved the green color and length of sk
i tried, but odd fit the print and fabric are great  but this dress has odd construction  or maybe i have an odd construction  anyway  i m      weigh            d  i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms   but the issue was in the hips  i m somewhere between athletic and curvy  the skirt looks more a line in the photo  but it s actually cut pretty straight  spanx would have helped  but i m not about to wear spanx all day in a work casual dress  i think a medium would make the top too big  so i
fit issues! so these look so good online   i love flare and the button detail  however  on me  they were very long  which i knew  but too thigh hugging for my taste  and the buttons looked cheap  i ordered the tan color   thus  back they went  for reference  i am      and    # and ordered the   
nice quality but boxy fit this is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy  i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then  flare out  more around the waist down to the hem  however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look 
nan the quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless  it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should ve sized down  but even in the s i m afraid this would be far too large  for reference  i am     and     lbs  i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn t right on me  i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure  returned 
a colorful big box since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short  i m        it also is too big  the empire waist has no shape or flatter  the sleeves are huge  the neckline was falling off my shoulder  i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong    the print is very fun and my guess is that s what is attracting everyone to it   it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me   back it goes 
flimsy material i returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin  i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price  i was disappointed  it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper 
wide cut very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent  like and it looks like a maternity top on me  i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back 
dissappointed was very surprised when i opened the package  this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through  the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all  i have a short waist length so it should have worked  the color is a little darker than pictured  but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced  going back asap 
extremely flowy i like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy  the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful  i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year  it has to go back though  just too large  i don t love it quite enough to order a size down 
too short i really didn t expect this sweater to be so short  i m      and there is no way it would fit me properly  i honestly didn t even try it on  i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it  it looks like a crop top  i bought the blue  which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture  i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss 
weird fit this is cut very strangely  i m short waisted and this barely covered my belly button  the material is rough and scratchy  did not like at all and will be returning 
pretty at first glance i saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now  its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design  i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn t for me  its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn t have a small left in the sizes  i ordered a medium and it still ran small  i was very surprised  its was also disappointing
gigantic this looks cute in the web photo  unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person  i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me 
nan the black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips  emphasizing them  the pants are sheer  the fabric was not comfortable against my skin  overall  the pants were a miss 
not so flattering on the backside i love my very old pilcro stet jeans  they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush  not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately  the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs  and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide  it s a bummer 
not for everyone if these jeans work for you  you re a lucky girl  the fabric is really thick and soft  pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail  i ordered down a size  they re tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a     inseam  the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway 
nan these jeans are adorable  i m so sad they didn t fit  my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants  if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you 
disappointing these jeans were so cute on  wore them a handful of times and they d been washed twice  put them on and   rip  ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable  and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear  poor quality   disappointing and not what i expected from retailer      they also run large even for a more relaxed fit  sized down for a good fit 
boxy, short and unflattering ordered this top online  as i loved the colors and design  but i should have listened to the other reviewers  i ordered my usual size m  and it was just very unflattering  it was short and wide  not at all like it s pictured on the model  needless to say it was immediately shipped back 
not like the picture at all i ordered my usual medium  the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering    the armholes were right under my arms  too bad as this looked so cute in the picture  i returned 
great dress, poor stitching after the second wash  the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart  after sewing it back up  wearing it  and washing it a third time  the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well  not sure if this was just a fluke  but it was very disappointing  now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact  i must say that this is a great dress  i would have returned the dress to retailer  but i ve already washed and worn it  so again   very disappointing  i would say
hook and eye issues with all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress  it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative     line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement  i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn t come undressed  i suppose i could ve gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back  i didn t see tha
huge for petite when i ordered this online  i should have paid more attention to the picture  the dress comes to the knees of the       model  i was swimming in small petite size  i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size  nope  it was ps  either the dress was mislabeled  or this is cut huge  returning  too bad because the shape and color are cute 
disappointing i built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers  moss  copper and burgundy  they are soft  well fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory  this new version is stiff material  and ill fitting  not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front  with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit  disappointing and going back 
cute but too short this top is very cute and if you are short you will love it  i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird  it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top  had to go back 
i really wanted to like it....but the dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large  it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well  if you are going to try it  probably size down   sizes  for reference  i m      and     lbs  i bought my normal size   and it was very large  i would not recommend as it s just not flattering  i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i m an retailer devotee    
super frumpy this looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online  it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on  looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head  the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me  i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs  its kind of itchy too  will be returning this asap 
not what i expected. i had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off  they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down   i usually wear a    or     and the    fit nicely through the hips and thighs    unfortunately  the color is off  i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray  and they have a button fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion  i will be returning them 
beautiful, but cheaply made i ordered this coat because  like others  i was taken by its feminine beauty  unfortunately  the coat showed up with the top button broken off  and missing  and another button hole torn open  i returned that coat right away  thinking that it d been damaged somehow in shipping  however  i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button  when i tried on the coat  i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket  not the quality i expe
delightful, different, gets dirty asap i love the design and fit and quality  have been looking for a long line top like this and was willing to pay full price  i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely  smooths it all out  i m a   c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top      here s my issue   wore it once and the colors ran  i was so excited to wear this i didn t even wash the top  i rinsed and dried the bottom  though   and i m not a swimmer  just let
buttons have not been fixed despite retailer's claim despite retailer s claim that they have  fixed  the button issue on this coat  beware  they haven t  i ordered this coat november   th  feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed  because retailer indicated  rest assured  this issue has been fixed   as noted in the item description   feeling confident that i d get a non defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle  i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight  nov   th  immediately di
weird this dress just fits weird  maybe it works for somebody      there is a reason it has been put on sale   
not for skinny girls this is not even a dolman style sweater because it s loose fitting everywhere around the arm  the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater  it s super loose around the wrist area   i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve 
way too big! i was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large  i was pratically swimming in it  really love the design and the way it looks on the model  just didn t work out that way on me 
oversized bag this sweater has the weirdest stitching  although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die   poor fit means poor sweater   
had to send it back i was so excited to order this sweater  i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days  ordering it on sale made it all the better  however  when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were  with little definition  the sweater itself lacks definition as well  just shapeless and hangy  i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on 
looks old even at the store but nice design although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it  it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found  the fit is nice but i wouldn t buy it due to the material being too delicate 
so wanted it to work this dress has a great shape and fabric   but the v neckline is too deep low and the arm holes are also cut too low  would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return 
disappointing this is a really nice quality dress  it is a low cut v neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move  i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me  it s a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel  i am petite in size          lbs   i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length  also  the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd  the skirt hit right at knee height 
holy enormous! this is the widest sweater i have ever seen  i laughed out loud when i opened it  and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too  it is comically wide      even when i was       months pregnant  the m l would have been pretty roomy on me  now that i m back to about a size        this looks like jared from subway s pre weight loss pants  in sweater form  ridiculous 
the stitching is beautiful but..... the sweater could be really pretty  but it is huge  i ordered the xs s and it was swimming on me  it s too bad  because the stitching was beautiful  but this item is going back 
could have been better... i grabbed my typical size     and found it fit snug in the bust  the fabric has plenty of stretch  so the snugness was fine  especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front  it s lowcut  but i didn t feel particularly exposed  i ended up not buying it because i don t think it fit my body right  the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me   a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole
dress in catalog is not the same i saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase  then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money  look at the top  the stripe colors are different  and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well  and the dress was short on me and i m two inches shorter than the model  bummer 
tall and lean this dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains  it is sturdy beautiful and strong  i looked like a large picture window in it  if i was       and     pounds it may have worked  
top is too shear with see through front this is a sweet top as it is shown  on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top  this is not so the entire front of the top is see through  one would need to wear a camisole  the material on the blouse is very sheer it appears to be rather cheap actually  if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath  that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
beautiful fabric but... nice quality fabric and design  but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange  wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
huge tent this dress looks cute online  but it is enormous  i bought a small  but it looked more like a  x plus size  i tried it on  just in case  and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown  this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo 
very disappointing!!!! i ve been eyeing this dress for months  so when it went on sale i finally purchased it  now i see why it s on sale  the dress runs extremely large and has no shape     looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo   moo in it  this will be going back to the store    
color not as pictured i had high hopes for this top based on the photos  but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top  the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it  almost like a tie dye or slub effect   not pretty at all 
colors look nothing like online photos:( when i saw this top online  i thought i d love it and immediately ordered it in both colors   they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed   i have never seen such drab colors   the blue is a muddy grayish hue  like an overcast day  and the pink is a dusty shade of peach   yuck   and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon like flowy effect   instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit   back these go   
a wallpaper potato-sack the title says it all  while the quality was good  when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper  the length was longer than on the model  makes sense since i am only        which was ok  but the overall fit was just too big  i am a size   and tried the xs  which was huge  just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way  going back 
listen to the reviews--pass!! man  this dress is the worst  i don t understand how it looks the way it does on the model  agree with previous reviewer   there must be a minimum of     pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back  this dress looks so cute   but is so  so  so disappointing in person  sweater collar and cuffs   stiff and bulky  dress   billowy and sack like   not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in  save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like
blah i just received my back ordered wildberry top in blue  it s not blue but instead a dull  mottled purplish hue  it looks like a well worn  stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom  so disappointing  it s going back for sure 
wow... so disappointed  i love retailer  this was a huge disappointment  i am      and     pounds  when i put it on  all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look  if i wasn t so disappointed  i might have laughed  this had to have been a design mistake  i ve truly never seen something so unflattering 
great dress such a great dress  fit is flattering  the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd  classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes  thrilled with purchase 
nan the cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material  but the dress itself is extremely thin  the non belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress  which was enormous in my normal size 
couldn't send it back fast enough! unlike the other two reviews   i found this dress horrid  i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s  it was just too much fabric for me    i have a small frame  so it was just so overwhelming  the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me  colors were nice and fabric was soft and light   the belt made no sense as others have said  length was good  i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn t take it off fast enough  i literally ran to the post office and back it goes  this is my
nan too full of a dress for me  i tried a belt and it is then too chunky  if you are younger  tall and slim  this would look great
too much fabric as soon as i saw this dress i ordered it   i didn t want to miss out on it  i loved the look   the colors were so fun and bright   i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii  i am      about    #  i ordered a pxs  when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric  i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful  part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c
i really wanted this to work... but like other reviewers said  it looks nothing like the picture of the model  i am      and     lbs  i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite   the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material  it looks like i m   months pregnant  and i usually love loose dresses like this  but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes  so bummed  because the material is beautiful and i lo
frumpy this dress had so much potential  looked cute when i received it  put it on   couldn t wait to take it off  it s shapeless  top heavy   just overall unflattering  the material could be cute    on a totally different dress  don t waste your money 
not loving the extra stretchy fabric long time ag jeans fan  lately though  i m finding the material is much too stretchy  i wanted a good pair of jeans  if i wanted pajama jeans  i would ve ordered them  i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered  same review there    so back both pairs went    it s a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted  if only they had been made out of actual jeans material 
tight under arms this jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare   this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders   it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me  this jacket is not sized correctly 
a no go.... contrary to the first review  there is a zipper so while it wasn t easy to get on  it did fit over my bust  i found this too small and high waisted  and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso  what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo  it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering  the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
pretty but cheap these are light and airy and pretty  they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam   a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed     they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see through as it is so thin  therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants   great   i would not leave the house in them    or turn over in bed in them     when i sit  the slits fall down around my thighs  my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way
waist doesn't stretch and no zipper bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top  the waist has no stretch and their isn t a zipper  you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders  so cute in the pic but not realistic  going back 
forget about wearing a bra i had high hopes for this top but it didn t work for me at all  it shows your bra straps perfectly  plus  it was so big and boxy that it made me look about    pounds heavier  no thanks 
star trek villain this top is really beautiful  but looks absolutely horrible on my      apple shaped body  in the words of my husband  i looked like a star trek villain 
nan i was so excited when i purchased this top  it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots  the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas     so comfy  that all changed after one washing      it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before  makes me sad  but it is going back 
weird, unflattering cut i wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work  the fabric is gorgeous  but the fit was very unflattering  it s too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes  i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise  in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn t compensate for the very unflattering fit 
pretty from far away, but... as soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high  i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day  the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all  it wasn t for me at all even thou
fell apart before my eyes was excited to wear the dress for the first time  but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on  the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel  strangest thing   just a random hole appeared    
so disappointing i was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment  it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it  the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange  it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral  the dress fit really awkwardly on the top  the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on  i normally wear a  p  and i ordered down to a  p  the waist
potato sack i look like i put a baggy bag over my head  also  the material really seemed like fake velvet to me 
pretty embroidery- beading but poor shape very disappointed when i received this  the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful  beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that  first it is nearly a crop top  second  it is boxy and it s attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky  third  need to size down   sizes  had to return this 
strange dimensions it s beautiful  lovely quality  gorgeous bird  but the fit just doesn t work for me  i m usually a medium  which is what i got  it s just too tight in the chest  for ref   d  as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i m not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
wrong color and too big i was so excited for this dress to come  i am   #     quot  and    lbs so i ordered and xs petite  it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around  maybe on someone taller this would have looked great  i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate  my dress was a much lighter blue  back to the store it goes 
a tad disappointing... i usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me  sadly  this dress is a definite exception  which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress  as other reviewers stated  the dress does run small  but even if you size up  if you have any breasts at all  the dress will pull at the buttons  causing them to gape  i m only a b cup  so not on the large side   i m pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture  i love
sheer and no slip? i m not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake  but i received the chiffon shell  but there was no slip as pictured  it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer  i had high hopes  but sadly  this is being returned  the xs is out of stock now  so i can t even reorder  bummer 
didn't work for me... i m on the shorter         side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer  this is a lovely suit but it didn t work at all for me  it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted  the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all  it was very tight and pinched  sadly  i returned it 
too thick this sweater was pretty short  beyond that  when i raised my arms  the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down 
frumpy i am          lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape   it was just big and frumpy   it went back  
nan this skirt looks great on  i didn t even think before buying it  planning to wear it all summer  so the aesthetic is great  quality and design  not so much  you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates  it is not sewn in or built to last      then  it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt  i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it  but they said they would have to resew the whole garment  not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran
wrinkles this dress is gorgeous as displayed at store  color is vibrant  but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily  i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived  the top is very wide and best to wear strapless 
fits snug this dress was too cute to pass up  i loved it online but when i got it home  it was so tight i couldn t zip up my normal size  the length was perfect on me being       the fabric and detail was beautiful  if you have a bust  order a size up  beautiful dress just really snug up top 
pills horribly i splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it  even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear  after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  it may be the worst case of pilling i ve ever seen in a fabric  so so disappointed  it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time 
too much material maternity like  and although the back is really cool  there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwear pajama  returned 
too sheer i agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me  if you don t mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you  i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up 
really disappointed loved how this draped and im super petite        b bust  and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned  i purchased the pxs and it was huge  i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review  i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off  unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest  too sad retailer  please get the fit right  
nan this dress is beautifully made  but it does not flair slightly as in the photo  it stick out like a tent  it might be a good maternity dress  the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture 
unimpressed this shirt is thin and shapeless  the quality is h m esque  unflattering  not a fan
not as shown i was extremely disappointed when this arrived  it s nothing like the red color shown  rather it s a very dull reddish color  as other reviews have suggested  it is very thin and runs large  i have to return 
way too large everywhere i ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large  i liked the color   the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage  overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me  i m sending this one back 
beautiful but extremely see thru the design is gorgeous  the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable  however  it s extremely see thru 
fits like a sack of potatoes! i tried this dress on in the store  i loved the fabric and color  but the fit was huge  no matter how much i sized down  there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose  but this was shapeless in an unflattering way  i was attracted to the style and color  but the execution left much to be desired 
zipper is weird i ordered the dress on line  this dress looked pretty  the material was soft and comfortable  the length was perfect  but the zipper was totally out of place  it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn  i had to return the dress  i normally don t see a problem at this level in retailer clothes 
looks better in photos- returning immediately i had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online  i jumped at the opportunity  i am        slender and always wear a small in retailer tops  i purchased this in the mint   size small and as soon as i opened the bag  i had doubts  the fabric is terrible  thin and scratchy  it is not soft and supple as i had imagined  the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful  the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot  the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the
disappointing loved how this top looked online and couldn t wait to get it  i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online  i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off  this is going back 
cute but poorly constructed i bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight    seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer  after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons  i ll still wear it but i don t think it ll last until next summer  kind of pitiful since it wasn t a cheap o dress  also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point 
not great quality after reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out  unfortunately  the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot  i like the idea but it s just not a flattering cut or material  going back 
too small in the chest for a size large i ordered a size large  however as a large  my chest is large as well  this nighty barley covered me  in the chest region   the rest of the body fit well 
doesn't look like the photo at all this arrived this week and i was so disappointed  the proportions are all wrong    from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material  if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be  weird  
loved this online i loved this top online and even more when i opened it up  however  the quality of the stitching is poor  where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone  i was bummed and am sending it back today 
tunic this top is well made and would be cute but huge  this top has no shape and is way big  back this goes j
patchwork denim tank i took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one  i ve been eyeing this online for quite some time  so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price  it came in the mail the other day  it s like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door  however  this time wasn t so great  the top is fine  average at best  the top fits true to size  maybe it s the pattern or the cut  but it didn t work well on my body  i recommend trying this on first 
exposure of material's backside disappoints while this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished  had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous  unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern  a glimpse of it under model s left hand   viewable through the very large arm holes  and impossible to hide   disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have  i was
not what i was expecting... i was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit  in the end it wasn t the fabric that was the deal breaker   it was the fit  in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body  i also felt like the arms are too big as well  it s going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size  it s a shame because the embroidery really is lovely 
like a bolt of fabric like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top  i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it  to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist  i wish there were smaller sizes to order  sadly  this is going back 
runs large the buttons on the back are very tedious  you will need someone to help you  if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock  way too big  like a nightgown  nice quality  but not practical 
significant other required this dress is beautiful and extremely well made    if you can get into it  the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back  it s form fitting  so you d better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand  i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it s soooo form fitting i m afraid i wouldn t wear it 
not great too much fabric  not a flattering top  for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are          
grandmas draperies dress i had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i ve received this dress i m appalled by all the positive reviews    this dress is hideous in person  seriously hideous  and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it s incredibly restricting  the picture online is so misleading  the dress isn t even an ivory it s more of a pea green  so disappointed 
better on the hanger i thought it was going to be so pretty  it is ugly on  the macrame is thick  stiff and rough  the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless  yuk 
awful this coat is awful  just awful  i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress  it looked awful  i really really liked the softness and that it wasn t like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering  it looked so bad that i took it off right away  so disappointing 
nan this shirt was great for one wear  after just one wash  followed instructions to dry clean  it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet  terrible waste of money on a pricey top 
nan i liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough  but the thin fabric does not justify the price  it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two 
disappointing i saw this dress and loved everything about it  i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big  they were out of the smaller size  so i had to return it  the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture 
poufy ruching this should have been cute  but the fabric choice   ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist    super unflattering 
warm and attractive but too tight/narrow and short these could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee  i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman  these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of 
terrible fabric i loved the shirt until i washed it  awful fabric quality  cheaply made 
sad this couldn't come home with me.... so i really loved this dress  i am tall   ft  and the size   was perfect length  i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals  i would say it is true to size  i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of  flow  without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack  the back is just gorgeous and unique  here is why i couldn t make it mine  the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin  there is literally not much to it and i m not sure it wou
wanted to love it. i ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn t prepare me for the sweater s issues  it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous  i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back  seriously heartbroken 
swam on me! i ordered a size    and it was huge on me  very loose fitting dress  i didn t like the material either 
not as beautiful as online i m disappointed in these pants  which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets  in person the pattern and colors aren t as nice  the fabric is too thin  and the pants look cheap  the pockets are pretty shallow  the fit isn t good either  i ordered up  i m between sizes  and they re still not as flowy as i d have liked  these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them  so they re going back  if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit  they might wo
disappointing blouse i was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse  the purple version  but the design is terrible for me  it s boxy  i didn t like the fabric  and the arm ruffles are bizarre  it s going back tomorrow 
these are not higher waisted pants. these pants are more like    not      i was very dissappointed  the color is great and so is the fabric   if you look more closely at the model the pants don t fit her either   they are too small  i haven t decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight  i am a    so far but these pants are like a     i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer
poor quality i ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color  just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work  unfortunately  it is poorly made  i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart  after closely inspecting the cause  i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together  so the minute you put it on  one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect  it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
odd fit this dress had an odd fit  very loose on top with pointy darts  very tight on bottom  fabric was stiff so it didn t move well with me
strangely cut was super excited to try this on  but had to go up   sizes from my normal   and the waist was still too tight   i was swimming in the top as well  just a very strange cut and unflattering  such a bummer because it s so pretty 
doesn't fit fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front  will return
bad lining i ordered this dress in my usual sz   it seemed to be tight on the hips   then i tried the next sz   and it was tight because  i realized that the lining was very sticky  and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me  not for curvy on bottom  i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason  i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute  and i really liked the look of the dress  if it goes on sale i may purch
not worth the effort generally  i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent  so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses  the bust was way to small  so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me  it s till way too small  in addition  the shipping was terrible   the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this  and the right strap was defective  it s so irritating that i have to return this again 
nan the cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering  it is great quality  but designed poorly  returned it 
runs small yet very billowy skirt what is going on with maeve sizing this season  in the past two months  i ve purchased two maeve dresses that run very small  particularly at the waist   having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it s impossible to ignore that maeve s sizing is quite off  that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great  the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal  strangely  it s a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time  there bodice h
returned the fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos 
poor quality unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash   gentle hand wash cycle   also  there are no bra straps holders  and my bra straps did show up a lot   
yikes! i was so excited to get this top    and while it is soooo amazingly soft  i still could not keep it  i must admit that i am only       so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this    but i felt like a matador  which is definitely not what i was going for    maybe if your tall and lean  this would work   but for me  no way 
very thin material. nice colors i agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric  i thought  insulting quality  for the price  i imagine the holes would start after one wearing 
how do you spell my-mu? i love the pattern adn color combo  but  wow t really flatering on me  too much fabric  i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu  anyway  not for me  but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me    too bad   length was decent in regulat size though  not too long  just too wide 
beautiful concept. failure in reality. beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me  where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am  same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams  i m      and a classic size   and this
not as pictures material is strange  triangle top is funky  this is just not awesome in any way 
wrong button choice i agree with the other reviewers   the fabric is beautiful   although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn t require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness  i mean for the price shouldn t it be lined or something  when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low  but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can t really complain too much  plus they are so loosely sewn on that after    minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off  i gave up at that
very thick & shapless, runs large this dress didn t work for me at all  i m  ft tall     lb  i usually wear size l       but based on the reviews i ordered an m  the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy  color is about the same as pictured  also length is appropriate  dress is very thick and warm  the fabric however has no stretch at all  dress is very specious and shapeless  there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders   sleeves  i thought that area was tight   snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
way too big so  ordered online  tried this on  boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes    back it goes  super cute but huge 
nan way too big and had a granny like styling  was very excited but ultimately took it back 
beautiful, but can't be used. this top is absolutely beautiful  the fabric is great  the cut is nice  etc    however  the buttons are too big for the button loops  which do not have any stretch  it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on  once i had it on  i left it unbuttoned  i returned it   if you can t live without it  you could put smaller buttons on it   too pricey for a non functioning top  too bad 
nan a serious joke  i struggled with the buttons for a good    minutes and gave up after the  rd button  i m not sure what they were thinking 
material was fuzzy and itchy i got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy  the prior reviews stated it was  warm and cozy  and not itchy at all  but i found it to be uncomfortably so  the dress was true to size for me and the length was good  i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough  the material reminded me of mohair 
just odd i am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress  maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered  but i still don t think it would have worked  the fabric is very soft but that s where it s qualities  for me  ended  the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips   for reference i m      and      hourglass    dd    the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me  like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it 
nan this looked nothing like the picture on me  was long and very unflattering  belled out greatly at the bottom also  the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality  but overall awkward 
nan i recommend this dress because it is beautiful  stylish and well made even though it did not work for me  i tried the small and extra small  the first   way too big  lengthwise  hit my knees  as well as in the shoulders   the latter to tight across the chest   not for me but worth a try  i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length 
not what i expected although i love retailer  this product isn t the quality or presentation i expect from them  the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess  the fabric wasn t soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy  i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed  i returned the dress and will keep looking 
disappointing ... this whole order was disappointing  the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items   this sweater included were poorly made  there was a snag thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater   tried to tuck it in but it wouldn t stay so i ll be returning it 
coral roll top sweater. this sweater is thick and does cover the bra well  i did not find it to be well made  the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places  i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay  putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach  for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering 
not at all what i expected. i ordered the ivory of this dress  expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy  instead  i received a dress that looks like a ugly  vintage gone wrong curtain of fabric  the  ivory  is the color of yellowed newspapers  the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place  i would ve been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music  the fit isn t that great  either  big and boxy  it could acco
disappointment the material is horrible  it s heavy and cheap  the skirt does not  flow  as it appears in the photo  instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles  am returning 
not for petite/short-waisted i purchased the dress with the bow back shift in peach because i loved it s nautical theme pattern   when i recurve do the dress  i found it to be stiff and boxy   being a petite  short waisted person  the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly   my bra strap was showing in the back  and the dress needed to be pulled up about   inches to properly sit on my frame     i returned the dress
really wanted to make it work as soon as i saw this dress  i absolutely fell in love with it  when i got it  i noticed it was slightly small  but figured i could deal with it  i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back  i could fix it  but honestly a dress shouldn t start falling apart before you even wear it  it s cut on the small side  wish i tried the larger one  but now it s sold out  and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured  i
don't buy this dress!! blue stained my dress! on a hot summer    degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag  i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress  great dress and such a wonderful fit   too bad its unwearable now 
terrible quality cut cut out design  no seems or hems    very disappointed in retailer
cute but won't last wore it a couple of times  it is cool and comfortable  washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray  i might get one or two more wears out of it  hand washed and hung dry 
absolutely awful i was so excited to order this dress  i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn t a hole in the back  but this dress is just plain awful  the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra  then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric  i could not get the zipper to lay flat  the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling  on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
nan i ve been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for   weeks  it is already tearing at the seams somehow  the quality of this is very poor 
not as hoped i wished these fit a little better  unfortunately  they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn t pull the waist of the pants up  i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out  needless to say i made a return 
horrifying fabric i had a dress that felt like this in       it jiggles  even if you don t  no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord  the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy  all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren 
child-sized!!!! the small  zipped and laid flat  measures     across at the bottom of the armholes      at the waist and     from shoulder seam to bottom edge  it s too small for a size    and not by just a little  too bad  because it really is very pretty 
nan it s way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me 
nan poor quality  material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured 
scratchy! i loved this skirt on the rack  but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn  i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on  so sad  such a gorgeous skirt 
itchy and oversized i m     and    lbs and i was swimming in the small  the arms are very boxy  the sleeves too long  and and it just wasn t a flattering fit at all  the color and design on the front are both nice  the sweater is made in china and very  very itchy  i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers  but there was no way this was going to be comfortable  very disappointed  especially given the price  but perhaps that s why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale  this one is going bac
too big it was huge  material looked good but was too bulky  will be returning it 
nan i loved this dress when i saw it in the store  the colors  weight  fabric  love  love  love    unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers  the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large  i tried on a size   petite  which is my usual size  all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets  truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way  but in the end  i had to pass 
disappointing i ordered this because the reviews were outstanding  i am returning it  although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky  moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far    into over the top victorian cutesy   overpriced  to boot   obviously  mine is a minority opinion 
nan material was a tad rough for my liking  the color did nothing for my olive complexion  given the price of this shirt  even with     off  i don t think it s worth it  if i m spending       on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one   going back 
not like the picture the neckline is very tight and itchy  the arm holes are deeply cut  the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture  it s short waisted  it s too bad because the embroidery is very pretty 
not as pictured and described when i read car coat  i expect a little more weight  it really is just a thin  long blazer  also  the colors appear different online  i expected a red maroon with bue and white stripe  so maybe i mis read completely     it is actually brown mustard beige combo  not what i expected  so it will be a return 
runs so big i m a short girl  but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer  for me  i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered  this shirt is adorable  love the details  i wanted it so bad  which is why i paid so much for a basic t shirt  still  it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v neck to break up the dots 
nan i saw this in the store and was glad i didn t order it earlier online  i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person  i like more unusual and flattering pieces  and this just wasn t it  no compliments here 
awkward. just awkward. i loved the look of this top online   it had great lines  i was so disappointed when i received it   it has zero support lining and i m not large chested to need a lot  it s also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it  making it even harder to get off  it was returned 
odd shaped coat with stripped bands sewn in ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats  the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight  the coat has an odd shape   not a line or straight  the medium was large on me  the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges  sadly this coat will be returned 
too much fabric this open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric  even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it 
low quality for price this suit did nothing for me  the top has zero support  this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested  also  the top gapped in the center  it just did not fit right  the top is very thin showing everything  a light padding would make a big difference in this suit  also i could not get a good fit  as i tightened the top  the back would ride up  the bottoms are ok  not renatkable
excellent style i loved the way it looks on  fit tts  only problem for me was it was so itchy  there is that small amt  of wool in it  if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
pilled immediately the first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides  it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash  possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i ve ever seen  like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can t be shaved off 
nan unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections 
runs big this dress looks so cute in the pictures i love the style  ordered typical size and it was huge felt like many sizes too big 
dress is made for broad shoulders and small waist the fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible  i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders  what a pity  had to return 
nan this top looks beautiful online  when i got it  it looks nothing like the pic  it s wide  too much fabric  no shape and so unflattering  it s definitely going back
nan i was really disappointed when i tried this top on  the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off  the cut of the top overall was just off 
ugh very unflattering and no shape or flair  lots of extra material but no swing or shape  do not recommend 
circus tent i love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person  i m     and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest  i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering  i feel like they could have made about   shirts out of it  i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown  if there were just less fabric  i wo
if you're craving the marsupial look... then this one is for you  so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt  as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale  based upon the pictures  i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail  but it is actually masking this skirt s ugly secret   a pouch  yes  it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen  which does not lay flat  the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots                  this one
unnatural feeling fabric, slim fit sadly  going back  ordered m  light color option  very difficult to pull over my head  not a good sign  got it on and neckline looked attractive  height w o being a mock turtle   but whole thing a bit small around middle  could order the l  but i m not liking the feeling of the fabric  it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch     cotton    poly    acrylic and    rayon   spandex  contrast   which must mean the stripes  combine w fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle
disappointing this top doesn t at all fit like it does on the model  the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt like  i typically wear size small or    but perhaps an xs might ve fit or looked better  sadly i must return this shirt 
the circus is in town at first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette  the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent  without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about    inches     the material is still beautiful  and because of that  i haven t decided whether i ll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape 
too much fabric i really wanted to love this top  but there is way too much fabric  it looks nothing like the pictures  it was more like a maternity top vs  a swingy top  i ll be returning this one 
not for me... i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful  i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large  the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked  and felt  huge  needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale 
not for the petite or large chested did not work for me  whatsoever  the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn t fit like on the model  the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn t make my figure look the way it normally does  aka i looked frumpy and chunky  which i m not  going back 
hideous so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer  this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute  it looked a million times cuter in the photos 
truly unflattering! granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model  but i am tall and reasonably slender  i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment  this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who knows what that you d keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm    and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose  i was looking for a statement
wanted to love this i saw this sweater on line and loved it until i tried it on  i m      flat chested      pounds and i ordered a size small  the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms  this sweater will work great if you are short  consider making your sweaters a little longer  because i do not consider myself tall 
classic versital shirt i purchased this shirt in white and black  the white is more ivory isn  and is a bit thin see through  the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt  i just wish it was a little more form fitting  i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric  very comfortable as well 
put a stop to this top i love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended  not so  for starters the top is much more of a beige in person  a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully  secondly there is just so  much  fabric  it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i ve tried to hard to make it  work   lastly the
sloppy, shapeless, ginormous top i sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent like  the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute  feminine details 
unstructured and not "expensive"-looking i bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it  i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well  however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and  horrors   an elastic waistband  this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result  back it went 
i looked like a clown don t get me wrong  this is probably cute on someone else  but not me  i looked in the mirror and just laughed  it was that bad  so if you re considering getting this  size down  ordered mine in large and it looks like i m wearing a barrel  the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape  the fabric is soft  i m just over trying peplums 
nan i love the dress as shown in the photo  thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store  it is sheer  can see thru it  can not wear this to work 
great if you are thin! i wish this shirt would not have had so much material  it would make a great maternity top  if you are really thin  it might work for you too 
shrinks!! i recently bought this dress and wore it once  i really liked it  it was comfy  cute and fit well  but    then i washed it  i followed the washing instructions exactly  but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it s completely unwearable  i m super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer 
wanted to love this dress after trying several sizes  including petite and regular  i am sad to return this dress  the regular sizes were too long on me  i am       and although the petite fit me just a little short  the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me  i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn t get the fit  usually i have great luck with cloth   stone 
disappointing this dress is adorable in the photo  however  in reality  it fits like a tent  the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it  it flares out in the skirt to become an a line and it s just not very flattering  if i had read the reviews before ordering  i would have sized down  but i ordered before any reviews had been posted  sadly  i must return 
weird fit i am             lbs  ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized  it fit like a parachute  you could fit about    of me in the bottoms and very short  nice quality material  but extremely awkward fit 
too short shorter than written tunic not dress dress is nice but can t be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself  it is around     in length so is more of a tunic than a dress  i m only     and it was too short   can t imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this  
uncomfortable i didn t realize that there were sequins on the design  they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable  the white material was also not very flattering on me  it went back 
nan i took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs  i am     and      i could take them off without unbuttoning them  they were hugh  even the xs  they looked like a halloween costume  even at the discounted sale price  awful and kind of made me laugh  but i guess that s why they are still available at this sale price 
wanted to love it the color says red but it s more like a rust  i m      so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything     finally returned it without it making it out the door   
love blazer but sizing way off i have blazers in size   from this designer and they fit with room to spare  i understand this is a more fitted style  but it is still way too small  size    and size    were not much bigger  great colors and cute design  but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it  i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size 
fabric is poor quality i purchased this jacket in my local store  size    and runs really small   i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality  i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling  looks like it is worn in an bad way  returned the next day  this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad 
nan this is the tiniest blazer i ve ever purchased in a size     i usually wear an    but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small  it s very attractive but please size true to size
nan it s a cute idea  but it s so low cut and the material is very thin  i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i ll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it  i m only keeping it because it was such a good price  also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten 
nice enough item on sale with discount just recently purchased and think it s ok for the price  would never pay full on this one   that s from an retailer shopper who s purchased plenty at full price  design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so so on construction   the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly  steaming laundering don t help    the shoulders also hunch up oddly  could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn t help that issue either 
sandstripe vest as a beach cover up this would be great  but i m surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn t show on the model how thin it is  it s pretty sheer and i couldn t get away without layering it 
not so great material is thin  with a fleece like feeling on the inside  hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material  the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward  shows way too much  would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath 
simple but large i normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me  the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well  the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others  i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look    pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me  i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short 
huge agree with other poster  this shirt runs very big  i m all for a flowy  shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent  i ll be retuning it 
not flattering on me this top is very soft and well made  for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering  i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it  it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won t show because this top is boxy and full in that area  if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try 
horrible the sweater runs large  the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy  i would never be able to wear it out of the house  however  the material is exceptionally soft and delightful  keeping as its a great stay at home   lounge sweater  but way over priced for this purpose  if you can get the fabric to lay correctly  you re a genius 
flimsy i loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body  it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections  bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges  these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me 
too big armholes i wanted to like this sporty dress too  i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level   plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go   go   go being  on  every second   the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared  i didn t like the middle  ridge  either as it was unflattering  it was returned 
nan i bought these last year and loved them  however they came in tall sizes  this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short  even at      im      and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg  i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal
nothing like on the model the model must have this sweater pinned at the back  the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything  but the fit is      at      with a long torso and broad shoulders  the large was still shlumpy  didn t hang right at all  bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering  my      uber fit daughter had the same issue  and she usually makes everything that doesn t work for me look amazing  returned 
too much fabric in the wrong places! usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes  this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee  it was baggy  hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless 
cheap fabric while i love the design and shape of this blouse  the fabric was of very poor quality  i will return it 
pilly extremely cute sweater  but after having worn it twice it s already pilling up  i d expect more for a      sweater 
too baggy this dress is just too baggy overall  i am          lbs and a size small was so unflattering  i can t go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me  it was already a little high on the small 
not my favorite dress i saw this one for the first time today in store and was not impressed  it is a lacey material with an under layer  so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous  unfortunately  i did not like the swing dress cut  especially not in white  i wasn t sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the   s or a shortened version of my grandmother s wedding gown  but either way it was not working for me  to be fair  swing dr
stiff, thin, unflattering i was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired  it fits tts  length is fine   the inside is some  but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap  kinda canvas feeling    the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way  it also is on the thinnish side   it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm  this is definitely going back 
nan i don t normally write reviews  but i purchased this dress in white in   different sizes and each dress had the same flaw  the hems were very uneven on all three  this dress was poorly sewn  it s a shame because it looked awesome online  i was very disappointed     
meh so i m not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me  the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium  i m a size   bottom  and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose  i just think this one is going to take the right body type  it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me 
missed the mark i think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames  but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors  i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips  w a   b chest   i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m             this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep      above my elbow  and made my arms look huge  fyi  the v neck is very de
nan i love maeve but this shirt s quality was poor and it was not worth the price  i would not recommend buying this online  you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not       and in my case this is being sent back 
such a nice design.... this top could ve been one of my favorites ever  i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color  the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w o an extra tank  unfortunately after   wears  several small holes appeared around the neck under the ruffle  i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry  when i came to read the reviews  i noticed i wasn t the only customer with this issue 
defective! i wanted to love this dress  i saw it in the catalog in blue  and wanted it  however  for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it  and by the time i did  only the orange was available  but on sale  i was so excited when it arrived  and as i was trying it on  i thought  this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it s so pretty    and then i couldn t get my right arm in the sleeve at all  i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something  but n
not flattering i love the idea of this top  but wish there wasn t so much fabric  i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are          
shrunk like crazy! bought this shirt on sale  it was super cute in the dressing room  and for the first time i wore it  washed it per the instructions  wash delicate with cold water  lay flat to dry  and it shrunk so much i don t think i m going to be able to wear it anymore  it was oversized and loose when i bought it  so it shrunk a lot  there is also a small hole all of the sudden  that i have no idea where it came from  wasn t there when i put it in the washer   very disappointed 
not very flattering as much as i wanted to love this top  it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am  i m a size     maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference 
runs small it s a fine dress  but it definitely runs small  and it s actually a lot shorter than i was expecting  especially since i m only      
do not wash! i loved everything about this dress  the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall  i wore it once  washed it in gentle hand wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry  per the instructions  and it shrank at least a full size  it s going back  i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress 
disappointing the fabric  colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy  i am       and    lbs  and even an x small was too billowy to be cute  too bad  it s otherwise so great 
poor fabrication when i tried it on  it was a bit shapeless  but it was on a promo so i decided to get it  i kind off like shapeless  i ve worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended  in a lingerie bag  always  and air dried it  it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam  and i cannot see how this happened  the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin 
so disappointing i love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it  i was shocked when i opened the package  first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting  it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton  it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment  it is not a kimono at all  it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact  just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu
oh dear...where was this dress when i was pregnant review title says almost all  add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young  just too cute for words  i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart  this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous  i would have liked it for those   months but even then it would cover quadruplets 
so disappointed! i was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person  it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the   s with the red and white ruffles  pass 
looks great off but not on loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired  very wide under arms   too much material  looks more like a maternity dress  i ordered a small petite   would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available  oh well  returning this 
very large i love the design  that s why i m going back for a smaller size  i bought a medium and that size was made for someone    lbs heavier than i  usually i m good at choosing my size online  but not today  if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room  also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on  please 
not for me this dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on  great quality  fabric was lovely  just a little sparkle at the hemline  scallops were great but i put it on  i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return  love the look  it just was terrible on me  i m petite       and weigh    # so i m not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa 
design flaw i had such high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately it misses the mark completely  the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length  for someone who is         lbs  the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander s derelict campaign  i think one must have a specific body type for this dress  but regardless  they ll have to keep their arms at their sides 
way too short and baggy i couldn t wait to get this dress  i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag  while the fabric was beautiful  the sizing was way off  this dress claims to be     long  and i could tell instantly it wasn t  it barely covered my rear  i also know it s supposed to be flowy  but it was really  really wide  i can see this working for someone around   feet tall who is wider 
nan this top is really cute and i love the design  however  the first time i wore it  the waste band started unraveling 
nan the sweater material was really soft and seemed well made  the back is an interesting twist  but the material creases easily  i can see it looking messy by the end of the day  the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large  i got my usual s  and i could have sized down    maybe even   sizes  i didn t like it enough to try a smaller size 
more of a cover up this  is more of a cover up than something you would wear out  
why change a classic? noticed all the   star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets  so due to the past   years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans    i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula  thick denim  just the right amount of give and a flattering    inch rise  walked right in and found them  and i knew right when i touched them  they were still the thin denim that s nowhere near the quality they once were  consumers pay attention and t
not for chesty people this blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great  i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest  it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions  however   looks super cute on those more on the flat chested side 
waaaaay too much fabric i know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level   i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric   i do not think sizing down would have made a difference   if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify 
tight i generally don t spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale  who can wear these  i m an average size    and struggled to get these size   s over my hips  buttoned and zipped  i looked like a stuffed black sausage  best for thin frames and even then  size up 
wanted to love it... it s such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity ish so i returned it 
stiff silver lace i hate to be so negative but i can t believe this shirt has so many positive reviews  it is stiff  silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest  adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse  looks cheap 
stretch out fast perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch   they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn t buy them again 
frayed apart i loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than   times  it was not a fit issue or a seam issue  they literally just frayed apart in two areas   while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable   they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them 
color became spotty after washing i bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy  i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer  although nothing else in the load was blotchy  i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color  the same thing happened after the first wash  again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined    just my new retailer pants  such a bummer   definitely a dye issue  i called the stores i pur
only buy if you like baggy! my husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants  they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them  baggy in the behind and sloppy looking  they are going back asap 
not colorfast at all! bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only  my white washcloth turned bright yellow  the food came out but surrounding area was super faded  so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light  these pants are way too much trouble 
color ruins easily i bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg  i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage  just washed both pairs according to care instructions  no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent  and both came out with light spots all down the leg  very sad to have wasted all that money 
bad quality pants do not waste your money on this   at first  i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it  so i bought this pants in store too  i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless  i was so shock    fyi  i did not use bleach or chrolox  i mean i don  t use them i will return them both   still mad  this is bad quality enough worth it 
nan i wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great  however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable  very disappointing  did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once 
nan do not buy these pants   the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots  and i followed the washing instructions   i bought another pair and the same thing happened   i m out a bunch of money 
don't put anything in your pocket! i bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them  i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket  basic goody binder   and there is a circle stain where the binder was  so strange  i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them  the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them  they are ruined  i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them 
discolored after one wash. similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash  the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside  i d rather not call attention to that particular area of my body   could ve been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality 
ruined in the wash i loved these pants  they fit perfectly  and then i washed them  like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them  the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns  so sad   wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right 
loved this dress until... i absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black  wore it     times on hot summer days and it was perfect  very comfortable  easy to throw on and dress up or down  i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning  as i usually do  and after hanging dry  it became significantly more translucent than it had been before  i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it  it s as though the fabric completely changed after being wet 
cute but gross polyester i know we ve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable  but sometimes it s still that horrible texture  unbreathable mess  unfortunately  that s what this top is made out of  so it runs big  its billowy  and cute  but i couldn t get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric 
disappointed i have purchased a lot from retailer but lately  some of the items have been disappointing in quality verses cost  this being one  the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this  the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves 
not flattering the picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable  but they are not flattering at all  they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the  fold over  portion was not necessary 
adorable but poor construction this sweater is adorable and comfortable  but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything  i cannot even imagine trying to wash it  unfortunately  i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor 
i don't understand this dress while i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess  perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies  i hated that the zipper was in the front  i personally find it tacky and gawdy  while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn t see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me 
swallowed me alive i m petite  but even if i weren t  i think this runs very large  isn t form flattering at all  and overall looks dull  it most definitely does not justify the price  material is thin 
disappointed - totally different in person this tunic only barely resembles the photo in person   first  the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos  second  it s huge  i m      and typically wear   or  p in retailerpolgies  shirts dresses  i ordered the sp and the dress was at least     times wider than it needed to be  it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless  and the style doesn t really lend itself to use with a belt 
disappointing quality i almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week  but i m glad i waited to try it on at the store  i wasn t sure if i d like the length of the petite or regular better   i was so disappointed and didn t end up getting either  i have two bailey    dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft comfortable  this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don t match up from the
nan this is a great cut and looks good on  it is a very poor quality material  it balled and frayed in two wears  i returned it to the store 
i'd hoped it would be better. the black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful  the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color  it simply did not match  it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color  the fit was  ok   just didn t love it 
not retailer's best this sweater tunic is very poor quality   the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it  and  without a chunky statement necklace  it looks like your grandmothers apron  there just isn t any style to it   has to go back 
comfy but no good the sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through  also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear  after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing  i would not recommend this sweater 
disappointed because not what i expected i agree with the first reviewer exactly  beautiful fabric and  idea  of dress  looks stunning on model   but huge and shapeless in person like a tent  not at all what i expected when ordering a   petite  sadly  has to be returned 
disappointed the xs was too large on me and i m not a tiny person  while the dress was beautiful on the model  in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tent like  the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom  not flattering at all 
not as pictured i was really disappointed in the shirt  the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black  the photo does not accurately depict this shirt  i will be returning 
nan this is an extremely flattering dress  i couldn t resist buying it  even though i didn t come into the store looking for a dressier dress  which i feel this is  once i tried it on  i had to purchase it  its one of those things that i know i won t regret because at some point  an occasion will show up that i ll wear it to  its soft  comfy and flowing and accentuates the body s curves without being too tight or clingy  its a classic 
oh my oh my after reading all the reviews and sizing down one size  i got my top size m  i usually wear m l depending on the style  i m   ft tall      lb  i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top  i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists  no wonder there is such a low leap in price  it is a good quality though  and very nice pale peach color  no would not recommend  unless you wear  xxxl
i had such high hopes! oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment  the color is wonderful  the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that s where the compliments end  it s an itchy  cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso  i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece  so bummed  so so bummed 
yuck this looked beautiful online  but the skirt isn t      silk   the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels  with most of them containing some level of polyester  parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch  and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap  overall very disappointing   this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online   a definite return  i wouldn t even recommend this at first or second cut 
too sheer if you are over     this top probably is not for you  it is absolutely see thru  great style and beautiful light fabric  but you can see right thru it 
nan the fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it s hard to believe this is anna sui  i would say this is unwearable  there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best  going back asap 
too much cardigan i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses  my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what was i thinking when you try it on later  when i bought this  once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing    there s so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back  i wanted to love t
beautiful dress terrible material this is very large   i normally am a s m and i took this in an x   it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use 
orange lace part runs big, but lining is small i snapped this up under the     off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty  i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops  it is huge  i could have taken a medium if not for the lining    which is tiny  the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips  and it looks like a block and makes me look wide  who needs that  like i said  a medium would fit better and would not be so wide  but i fe
dissapointed... i was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer  this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms  it s clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me  i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it  it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure      and athletic   i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
weird when i tried this top on  i started laughing  the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton  which  instead of falling by the hips  juts out like wings  it s also huge  cute idea  wrong material and placement 
strange fit this looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it  but sadly the fit of this number is really off  it looks more like a tent  it must have been clipped in the back or something  i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good   
poof this looks so cute   but don t be fooled  it is so poofy  it does not look in real life like it does on the model  it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous  i was so disappointed 
very thin material i wanted to love this dress  as the length  cut  and color are exactly what i ve been looking for  but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is 
weird fit fits and lots nothing like picture  very wide like a tent dress 
perfect for summer! love this top  it s pretty  unique and well made  i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look 
huge i ordered an xxs online and it s still massive  the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup  the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning 
frumpy if you are petite i loved the criss cross part of this tank  however  it looked so frumpy on  the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent  i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on  i returned it  the material felt nice too 
if you have any "bust" not for you! loved this shirt when i saw the picture  unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it  you can t really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all  i am only   b   so would say of average size bust  this shirt will not fit well  there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering doesn t fit well   the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i d have thought from the photo   really wanted to love this   but unless you have a smaller chest it lik
cute top but very uncomfortable the styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin  kind of scratchy   has  almost no give to it   it is very uncomfortable on   is very restricting as far as  movement is concerned    cannot recommend   back it goes 
too big i love the teal color of this t shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful  however  the top is way too large   i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  so i ordered the size s  there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top   i know if i order an xs  i will have the same problem   below the bust  the top is not flattering and it amp #   s a shame 
pretty but weird fit i initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model  it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant  then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders  i m regularly a size   xs    d and     lbs and both size   and   did not work for me 
disappointed i looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money  i wear a size  p  was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress  for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up  the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on    thick and heavy  the overall fit was too big and very unflattering 
really pretty but sizing off my for me received this in the mail today and was disappointed  i typically wear a     but bought this in the   as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an    this does not fit the same at all  the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body  needless to say i will be returning this item
disappointed sleeves were tight  was difficult to put on    for the price  you want to love the shirt  sending it back 
adorable but runs big lovey top in the photos  however  its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger  i m         lbs    c  generally wear xs or  s in retailer tops  ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering  the lace work is so pretty  it has potential but the design doesn t work well for some 
nan beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off  the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine  if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large  would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest  such a shame since i really love the shirt 
nan this top is tight across the bust  i am a   dd cup  and more trapeze shaped than the picture shows  if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much  also  the sz    is what was tight   and i usually wear a sz    or    or small size top blouse  in the end  this wasn t very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top 
so sad! i was obsessed with this top  i ordered my normal   and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders  the slight puff was too far in  it didn t hit on my shoulder  so i returned it to a store and ordered a    it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders  i took it to the store and held it against the   and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the    both returned  i had no hope for an   
not impressed this is the first hd in paris top i haven t loved  high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color  this was an online only item so i guessed at the size  typically order a   petite  ordered the   regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length  it was oddly constructed  small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom  the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it on  too bad  but it went back
so comfy...so sad it didnt fit the fabric is great  the design is fun  i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out  the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected  so i had to return it 
nan this reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body  i m thin and usually wear a size    so i m not sure who this may look good on 
beautiful fabric, irregular fit the fabric and color are absolutely beautiful  the shape of the dress is strange   fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else  it was not flattering 
not made right this has such awful proportions  i m     and     lbs  ordered xxs petite  in the neutral color   the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust   it looks very unflattering  and it s very pronounced  i m only     and already the seam hits at such a high point on me  below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it s sewed  and it balloons outward and is very square from there down  very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
sizing is incredibly off i tried on this sweater   love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline   wrong   the seam came right across my bust on a medium  sized up to a large  same thing  this shouldn t happen  not sure who this would actually flatter   the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect  the fit needs work 
wanted to love but couldn't. runs small  arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest  would not recommend 
nan hahaha  this dress is hilarious  it looks nothing like the image  i am usually a   xs  and   was the smallest size available  so i ordered it  when i opened it  it felt like    lbs of fabric  i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big  until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress  once i looked in the mirror  i almost fell over laughing  the rest of the dress is huge  i don t believe this dress would be flattering on anyone 
odd design the design is very strange  the inner slip is quite form fitting  but the dress on top was just massive  like a sack  on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with  they looked weird just hanging off the side  so i tried to knot them like a belt  overall  this dress was not attractive on  it looks much better on the model  the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life  harsher red  blue  and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured 
nan i really wanted this dress to be perfect  but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering  the other reviewer is about   inches taller than me  perhaps it works better on a taller frame 
not worth it i can t believe the reviews this dress has gotten  i ordered it and was so excited to get it  when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone  while i love the color the quality just isn t there and its not worth the money even with the     discount i used  the fabric is not thick  in fact it is quite sheer for  velvet   i honestly wouldn t feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this  second is the fit  i m       a  xs on top   on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w
different fabric and looser cut i ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut  i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more  denim  version  the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit  returned it and kept the regular ag stevie 
not ideal i was not a fan of these leggings  these were very unflattering  i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out  i just didn t feel like they would hold up for even one season 
sad from ms designs i finally found this dress in store today and wow  i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms  they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock  what happened  only the color is nice  please get back to yourself ms 
enormous i was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible  the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent   absolutely no shape  they must have clipped the sweater on the model  for reference  i m     and     pounds and ordered a size small 
ugg! this skirt is gianormous  i usually take an xl or l  so i ordered both  the waistband on the xl was so huge  i didn t even try it on  i feared it would not stay up  so i tried the large  and it was big as well  i think i would have needed a medium  but as it is  it is not the cute a line that appears in the picture   i wonder how they even got it to look like that        it is huge  hip y  and bunchy  yuck 
extremely small pant! very small  so disappointed  they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived 
not for larger chests i ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top  it is much nicer than a basic t shirt     when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage  also  the overall length is listed as     long  but i think that is the back of the shirt  the front of the shirt is very short on me  i m         hitting well above my hip bones     if only this was much  m
nan legs are too wide  the fabric is rough to the touch 
cute suit-didn't work for me this suit was high quality  and a cute design  however  it is clearly made for a lean body type 
very thin material, not flattering i was very excited about ordering this top as i m tall girl    ft  and i like my back well covered  i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material  this top is incredibly thin and see through  though fabric is nice and soft  it feels more like a pajama top  all curves   bumps immediately stand out and it doesn t look flattering  i ordered   colors grey and black size large and returned both  although they were true to size
alas not as good as it looks the suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg  i was told that it runs small and to size up to a     i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better  the bust is fake and it turns out when untied  worst of all it emphasizes the tummy  all in all not a good look for me  i am not heavy but i do need tummy support  normally i wear an   and in garnet hill a    sorry but it went back  i really wanted to like it 
not what i expected... based on other customer reviews  i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer  however  the fabric is much heavier than what i d usually wear in the summer   the cut of the trousers were superb though   i like a low rise or hipster cut which these are   they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy  so if you are an xs these will be xs  or runs small for retailer clothing  if you like your clo
huge, long, lightweight not a pretty blouse   it s quite utilitarian in design   and it runs enormous 
mumsy it s thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it s scratchy will not last  i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears  it s a nice shade of offwhite at least  for me it s a no that will get sent back straight away 
very thin fabric, pretty disappointing i was so excited to order this top   it looked like it was made of more sturdy  soft cotton  but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true  it s incredibly sheer   you d have to wear a cami underneath  which defeated the point for me  the pleating in the front hides your bra  but you can see it from all other angles  i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra  which can easily hide under sheer clothing   i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
not what i expected i bought this suit based on the great reviews  i was so bummed when i tried it on  the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up  my torso is on the longer side so maybe that s why the bottoms keep coming up  every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa  i am     and    lbs and bought a   which is my normal size  i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that s the extent of what i liked about it  i will be returning it 
nan runs large  very boxy  white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin  it did not look as good as in in picture  very disappointing 
flawed the cut of the top portion of the dress is off  i tried on the s in store   it bunched up in the breast area  i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem   nope   still bunched up  for reference i am a   b  i would have kept the dress and given   stars if it wasn t for said flaw 
cream colored the top is more of a cream color than an ivory  it s also a bit boxer than anticipated  fit is true to size 
nan this top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color  it looked as if i d washed it in filthy water  it s a very dingy white  needless to say it went back 
unflattering i really love the pattern and the look on the model  and i thought i would love it  i ordered online  so i did not try on in store  when i tried it on  it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt  it is thick fabric as well  and has a lining  and the waist has extra fabric for the design  and it has pockets  so it all adds up to be way too bulky  it is not flattering at all and made me look    pounds heavier  i am returning this dress  sad  because it looks so lovely on the model  i am
nan this tunic looks awesome in the picture  however  it is made of an uncomfortable sweater like material not left of centers normal skin cotton  i was disappointed once i saw this in person  not a great material for summer 
completely wonky i got this in a l  and probably i am a m  however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way  i don t think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress  this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist 
returned wanted to love this  i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone  but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite  not keeping this   the side zipper  a complaint by many  really made it uncomfortable  also  the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd  loved the material and definitely the green print  but i knew i would never wear it  just looked blah 
not my thing... this shirt was just really missing something for me  i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric  especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse  i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection  however  the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck  i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking  in addition  the bow seemed to be too t
nan this sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on 
way too short i m           lbs  i ordered a medium regular  the dress fell three inches above my knees  this model is taller than i am  and it falls to her knees    doesn t make sense  i think retailer sends petites in place of regular 
way too big after reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea  as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs s was still wayyy too big  for reference i am     and a   ddd and usually wear an   but this thing was enormous  it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant  it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon  such a disappointment  the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
wish this worked! this looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn t believe it was the same jacket  it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it  i really wanted to like it  but even the xs s was too baggy  also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn t actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry 
extremely disappointed saw this on line and decided to  splurge  for the holidays  arrived today and is going right back  runs very small especially in the waist  trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper  fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture  appears cheap and very itchy  sooooo disappointed 
nan i m worried about the quality of the shirt  it looks like it may snag easily  i ve decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it  in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt 
cute but too many fit/fabric issues it s a cute topper  it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms  and because of the a line  through the bottom  but the chest is   sizes too small and i don t have a big chest  the fabric is very scratchy  and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped  and i suspect it had been worn   going back  not tracy reese s best piece 
nan i m returning this jacket  i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it s more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture  however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long  i actually can t get the zipper to zip at all  it s very rough and lightweight  and i m afraid if i keep trying to force it i ll just end up breaking it  sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality    thi
too small too small too small! this jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big  i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash  there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back
nan love the tegan tunic version of this dress  i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong  this runs so big  i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on  i highly recommend ordering at least   sizes down unless you want to look tent y 
unflattering i m happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me  i m      and     lbs and it made me look like i had gained    lbs  as others have said  the pockets make the dress even worse it s very hard to get them to lay flat  the material is lovely  soft and i liked the gray color  but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum 
nan love the jacket  so versatile  would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit 
great style but lacking quality i agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading  you can t possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured  it does however provide a great fit  i sized down from large to medium   and the brown color is really pretty 
dissapointed i love the ethnic colors   the creative woven design of this garment  that s what attracted me in the first place  however  some of the metallic threads had snagged   i thought the loose weave   acrylic yarns would lead to more snags   it would eventually stretch out of shape  also  it s very big  too bad it doesn t come smaller  in the online picture  it must have been gathered   clipped behind the model because it really doesn t fit close like that   the long armholes are not visible online as
big busts not allowed! this top looked positively vulgar on     i am a   d  and it was way too low cut   my boobs were spilling out    in addition  the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth     it just looked and felt cheap  unfortunately  this top will be going back 
too small i ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie  this item was too small  especailly across the bust  it was very well made and the color green is beautiful  but unfortunately  i will not be able to wear it  so disappointed 
nan i usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one  you can t wear it off the shoulders and it s weirdly sheer too  the only pro is that it doesn t include wool or fur 
didn't work for me i agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it s a much lovelier color in person  but that s about it for me  thoughts below                  pros     tts  i ordered the medium for my   c       frame and found it sufficient     the color is much nicer in person  as the other reviewer mentioned  it s a richer brown  think  mocha latte  in terms of color     the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it
much too big this top is so lovely  but runs soo big  i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home  i m normally a size     and i was positively swimming in this top  hoping to exchange for a petite sm 
it's huge. no  but i m not a small person  i m      a size   on top    on bottom  i don t love this on the model online  but i saw this on naomi s blog  love taza  and thought it looked amazing  i tried it on in my retailer  and while they only had a m l  since i m tall  i figured that d be fine  oh  no  not fine  it s huge  like  it could almost cover a twin bed  it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model  and doesn t arc down in a drape nearly as well  so just looks  huuuge  i thought i was bein
non-existent waistband ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box  tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist  within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips   glad i was at home  looks cute but will not stay up 
waist falls down! i ordered these pants in my usual size  xl  and was shocked when i received them  the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up  i couldn t keep them on so  of course  back they go  too bad  the sweater quality is great 
no elasticity :( i wanted to love these  they are cute and warm   but they have absolutely no elasticity  i m so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping   pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store 
wanted to love it, but... i saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work  the cut was so strange  it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist  i even ordered up a size based on reviews  i ordered an   when i normally where a small     in things  the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else 
nan #childsize  not sure where this went wrong but it s going back immediately  always wear a     in retailerpologist skirts  this size   runs at least two sizes too small  the material is beautiful  but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric  so disappointing 
not as pictured i loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit  however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different  the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams  i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse  they looked obscene 
so small, so sad. i have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans  my favorites are the cords i got last year  similar to these  so when i saw this fun pair  i had to have them  i ordered both the    and the    to try on     they are even more beautiful in person than online  and they are so  so small  it wasn t like they were a tad snug  i couldn t even get the button across to meet the buttonhole  on the        i ve never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before  this was an extra depressing first time
slip pass this one a truly unwearable slip  scratchy fabric  bunchy skirt  teeny bodice  it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper  the foil kind 
poor fit! so wanted great pair of sweater leggings   great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple  these are not that  these fit very poorly   i ordered the small  which is more like a large one in the waistline   there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them  unfortunately  i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times 
get these if you want to run around bare-bottomed! i am so sad i have to return these leggings  they re adorable  so much so that my fianc   commented favorably on them  but as other reviewers have pointed out  there s no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they ll fall down  why  sleeping on snow  whyyyyyyyyyyy  they re so great otherwise 
constricting i tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move  you can t lift your arms  i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas 
weird construction i liked the design and i didn t mind that is see through  but i couldn t put it on   not size   what is my usual size   not size    or     even     my shoulders wouldn t go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed  i really wanted to like it 
not flattering i felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way  the waistband is very fitted  but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips  it s also see through      fit is tts 
nan this shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures  it is short and very wide  i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid 
boxy and runs huge i bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused  it s not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos  it s made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch  i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and   e bras size and it fits like a  x or larger  i would say order two sizes down  also it hangs like a maternity shirt  i might order it once it s on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it 
cute but not cute enough this blouse is a disappointment  it runs so large  it looks ridiculous  the cute is super wide and flared  they must have it pinned on the model  it is not flattering at all  i really thought this could be cute  not worth the money either  it s expensive and ill fitting  for reference i am     and    lbs and wear a   or   
nan sadly  this has to go back  i am           lbs and this shirt is super short on me  very short  and it s so wide it s almost a trapeze cut  the overall effect is   s   s style maternity shirt  which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great  i am not very tall and i m fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight  the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering 
nan if i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for      i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse  the problem area is evident looking at the photo   the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice  i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house 
design great; fabric terrible i really wanted to like this dress  the color is perfect  the design and cut are cut  not always the case at retailer   however  the fabric quality was terrible   a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace  it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back 
dress can't be cleaned retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it  however  this dress cannot be cleaned  i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it  however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse  i then tried dry cleaning it  the care tag allows both  and that produced   or   new stains where the black rubbed off on the white  it s a beautiful  striking dress  that would be great maternit
strange shape i m not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress  the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange  for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse  i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag  also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length  i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
fits like a potato sack i bought a petite medium and the length was right  but it fit like a potato sack  it was quite comfortable  and didn t look completely terrible from the front  but from the side  it was terribly unflattering  when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie  i don t do form fitting clothing  but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way  it s got to go back 
awful i have never written a review before  and i love retailer and shop here often  however  i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money  it is such poor quality  it looks thick and flows in the photo  it is very thin and it itches so bad  i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail  i will deff be taking it back  and do not recommend it at all 
very itchy i had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy  im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest  not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver  wouldn t recommend it 
poor quality the material is so thin and so itchy  like other reviewers stated  it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper  i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy  otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots
nan way too much fabric  sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip   eek  might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself    the outer layer also doesn t feel like it will breath  add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer  returning 
so long!! i am of average height  but these pants are so long   i considered altering them because i like the print  but i don t think it s worth the effort for workout attire so they re going back  shame  
off i am not in love with this top and will be returning it  from the front it looks like a basic tee  which i expected  but the back  x  is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn t look like an  x  as the picture shows  so basically the focal point of the tee falls short 
cute style but poor quality i ordered this dress online  the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small  particularly in the waist  i normally wear a   or    but i ordered the    it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a   c  i liked the look  but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric  additionally  the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out  i returned it immediately 
runs large, too much fabric i thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is  there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top  the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin   not very good quality  i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck 
gorgous design, poor fit this suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal  it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out  i was very sad to return it    i am a size   with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
fabric has a sheen these pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me         i can go between a   and a    and tried the   and they were fine  that said  the fabric completed turned me off  it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it  i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they d be  the fabric is just too stiff  and the sheen made them feel cheap  unfortunately 
poor quality - seams split i purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they d be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe  on my second wear  i happened to be on a long haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper  outer thigh  luckily i d packed a back up dress  the pants weren t tight at all  but the seams wren t strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess  poor construction  i would not recommend these 
fades! falling apart. within   washings the color faded to a not so black black  like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year s use  after   or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off  the pants fit well  albeit a bit short  i m       and they run small  i sized up to a    when i usually am between a   or    i let the hem out  sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them  and now they are good to go  but for nearly     i don t expect to have to do this much work  these are not my first
nan i loved these pants  the fit well and were flattering  unfortunately after three wears  they came apart at the seam  very disappointing and frustrating 
pass on this one... like previous reviewers have said  these run a bit small and i m surprised no one s mentioned that these are very high rise  for reference  i m           lbs            and am an retailer size   in tops and pants  i really wanted to love these pants  but even after ordering a size up and trying on a    i was still not in love  and the other reviewers are right   the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up  the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares  so if you re thinking of ge
fatal design flaw... zipper in the back? these would have been the perfect black pants  great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction  but a zipper in the back     i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up  perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly   they were just too hard to put on  sending them back  since i don t have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need 
another big boxy top i had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top  i get the style but if it adds   lbs to your middle area its not for me  it is a thin material so it does hang nice 
terrible i m   ft       lbs true size   and these pants made me look like i had boy parts  super disappointed 
lint magnet so sad becuase i like the design  i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment  i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight  i had to take the sweater off and work in a t shirt    the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
bummer! ugh  i hate that this didn t work  the top shoulder sleeve portion is so pretty and unique  but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling  the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is  the sides go way up on me   the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash  back it goes 
cute top, poor quality i loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them  unfortunately after washing the turquoise one  it sprang several holes  the same thing happened to the second one after one wash  i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer  and they have washed and worn great  i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately  very disappointed 
too short waisted! i ordered this top in a     my usual size  and it fits fine  but it is way too short waisted  it looks nothing like what the model is wearing  her top comes low on her waist  almost to her crotch area  mine was just about   inches below my belly button  it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory  very strange 
great concept, too roomy, elastic band looks meh i really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering  i am typically a size    or    in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me  also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way  it had to go back 
frumpy and huge i was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium  boy is it huge  the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable  even the small would be giant    for reference i normally wear a size      my chest is    e and this was just so so huge  it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am   the colours are true and nice and vibrant    definitely size down with this one
beautiful but fit is off this top is gorgeous and i exchanged it   times hoping it would work  i originally got the size a would normally wear  a    and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem  i then went all the way up to a size    in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips  i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
has holes after first wear! i love cotton fabric  so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors  i have the dark red burnt orange color  and it is pretty  but i have worn the thing once  and today when i put it on again  i found   holes on the front of the shirt  so disappointed 
beware of washing absolutely beautiful top  worn once   hand washed and that s all she wrote  ruined   the black trim bled all over the top   i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal  do not recommend     
large with no shape this is huge  i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape  there is no shape to this and is a lot of material  i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters   it seamed like   sizes too big  the material is very soft and the collar is nice  there is a ribbon tie at the waist  the tie is wimpy and could be nicer  when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist 
disappointed in quality and runs small i have been looking for an off white vest and thought this one would be perfect  except it is going back  i am          lbs  medium is my normal top size  but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture  no buttons  so no way to close it  unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo  not worth the price 
too short love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom   these jeans have a    inch inseam not     so they hit at a very odd place on my calf  return  for reference i m     
great idea..poor execution i tried on an xs and it was boxy roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured  i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person  it took me back to my childhood  i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois   shammy  for short  that was awesome for soaking up water  and that s what it felt lik
cute but cropped sweater this sweater is so cute and seems high quality  i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste  going down just below my mid section  i wish it had been cut longer  i would have kept it 
awkward fit i don t have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine  i also ordered the xs even though i m usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked  already returned it  on the plus side  it s gorgeous 
beautiful fabric, no cup room got the coral reef color in a size medium  for reference  i say i am       because its easier than explaining that i am really      and               lbs     c bra  size wise  i am all over the place  recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an   to a    from retailer  i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors  everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups  i am not especially big but there was zero cup room 
nope! weird fit and the tie just add to the problems  i think i d like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie  the tie seems like an after thought  it s flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house    no matter there size  i ordered a medium black and it s already in the mail 
black bleeds on cream! this top really is lovely  i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans  i wash everything before i wear it  though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned  so i hand washed it with delicate soap  when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color  i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub  it is cur
i really want to love this top... i want to love this shirt  i really do  but it s huge  the top is tent like  which would be adorable with skinny jeans  however the length of the back dips so low  the top kind of reminds me of pajamas  the color is beautiful  more like a light grey heather  and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material  overall  the top is cute  but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt  so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front  sadly  it s a return 
ewwww!!! i thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on  and i was majorly disappointed  it was incredibly unflattering  in every way  as a few of the other reviewers mentioned  if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely  the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant  i m     and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer  but this   ewww  i will say the color and material are gorgeous  but i m guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes
nan there are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted  not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress  i wish the pictures shown were more accurate 
soooo disappointed! i was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much  sadly  no  first of all they run small  i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side  these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them  the first time i washed them  they were ruined  i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer  the lace is man
greek goddess-style not for all! if you have any curves  avoid  it is not flattering   the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress 
wanted to love this skirt for the holidays... i am a size   and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous  it looked like a pirate sack  it s unfortunately going back 
slip is too small... dress is pretty  i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer  i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings  nice but not nice enough to keep  i am returning    
did not like the fit, but beautiful colors i really wanted to love this shirt  the colors are gorgeous  very vibrant and just as shown  the fit was all wrong on me  i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy  and  it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck  it looked like a sack on me  for reference  i am          lbs   with a small frame 
nan these are a beautiful color  but run large  i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me  they are very low rise so i don t think i ll be trying the smaller size  can t even imagine them being lower  also  they are cropped  that s hard to tell in the picture 
had great potential i tried this dress on in a   and a    a   is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea   the   fit in the outer layer  however as the previous poster mentioned  the lining is super tight  i couldn t even pull the   lining down over my hips  the   was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining  not sure what when wrong here but it s a shame because it s a really cute dress 
so unflattering i m sure there s someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn t me  admittedly  i m a less than ideal body type at a curvy    tall  still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit  c
super cute, horrible slip super cute dress online on the model  what you can t tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight  it might be my body type  otherwise  it s super cute in person and i wish it would ve fit better 
disappointing i assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t shirt sweater  unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is     acrylic and see through 
love and hate. this is a beautiful vest  i love the color blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility   i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains  i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash  they spot cleaned it  and it did bleed  although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric  i ll be taking it back into the store today for a ref
nan looks like a pregnancy top  a lot gathers in front and back  added    pounds to me  not flattering on  much longer than on the model  and the color is not white  it s white with a weird tan  taupe stripe   i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing 
petite proportions way off sizing is just getting unreasonable  and nothing fits unless it s a crew neck nowadays  this v neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model  but on my           lb frame  the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim  additionally  the shirt looked like it shrunk in length  and wouldn t have covered a belt on my pants  it also did not match the product description and measured     from the hps to hem  i m unsure of how when pattern grading an i
wanted to love it! well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much  i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be  i also feel it should be fully lined  it was not  the exterior wool and pattern is very nice  maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more  i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up  i realize this isn t in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
wanted to love this...but this dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small  the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering  i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back
nan runs extremely large  i got an xs and am         lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size       and is      and above  very disappointed with the size  the quality of the fabric wasn t great either  i wanted it to work so bad but just didn t 
wide, not as expected, or pictured wow this is huge  i m all for the tent look with the right style  but this was absurd  i could have fit two of me into the width  and with the peplum style  extra width doesn t flatter anyone  the fabric is also so thin that it doesn t hang nicely  it kind of floats around the body  if you want a wide top  then this is perfect  but if you wanted something that hangs nicely  look elsewhere  i purchased a petite s  my typical size 
too bad i just got this in the mail the other day  i was really excited and then crushed  one  buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo  it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling  it looked old and i wore it about   hours  i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail  it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back  too bad but not what i bought and then not
great idea, mediocre execution i really wanted to love this dress  but i think the proportions are very weird  i m      and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a    in more structured dresses  it runs small throughout  and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work  the front is nicely detailed  but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing  i tried on three different sizes       and     and they all pulled weirdly at the chest  there s a little slip that goes with the dress  w
not at all like picture this dress is a potato sack  from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird   and it s huge on me  so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not  also the fabric is strange  not at all what i expected  i m so sad    i was really excited about this dress 
bulky i am      and     pounds with an athletic cury body type  the dress wore bulky and ran large at size   
what happened! i have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer  however  the quality is very poor   it feels like it might fall apart after one clean  also  the buttons where not sewn on properly  i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price  or even close to it  
nan loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see thru  i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible  it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to 
maybe not great for a petite was excited to receive this dress  as it had some great reviews  however  of the love was coming from the       set  as a petite  this didn t work well for me  and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way  returned 
very poor quality i ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top  while they are the same price  they aren t even close in quality  this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen  the trim  pocket and the lace up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn t lay right  and the tag sewn inside  was sewn with red thread and showed through  very visible  i don  t think it would hold up after many washes  i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
not as expected i ordered this in a l online  and wasn t a fan when i received it  the colors are pretty bright  but they also look cheap in my opinion  it also had an awkward fit  because of the material there is no give at all  it was really tight on my chest    d  for reference  and it was also pretty short  and i m short  it barely hit the top of my pants   and i m      back it went 
what a disappointment i should have read the reviews first before ordering this top       buyers beware    you will not get the same top delivered to you  as is shown in this picture  the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all  and while there is a bow in the back  the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow  i hate to write a bad review  but come on retailer  i d never expect this from you  it looks like any other peplum white top  not something special like the picture is o
disappointing i loved this t shirt when i first tried it on  a good cut  not too drapey or fitted  but then i washed it  laid flat to dry  and it shrunk so much that it s unwearable now  so disappointing 
shrunk to toddler size i washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt  i dried it on medium  i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly  i loved the color  lilac   fit  and style when i received it and immediately put it on  so sad about the shrinkage  for a     shirt i expected a bit more  retailer should suggest air drying the shirt  so bummed and disappointed     i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time 
terrible! the back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt  it is very visible and looks terrible   especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt  do not recommend
poor fit the shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering  the back felt bulky and looked awkward  definitely returning 
felt too maternity i was bummed about this top  detail on back is pretty  even so  not worth it  i m usually an xs i m      lbs and it fit true to size  guess i had higher expectations  i m feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person   
not worth the money! i brought this shirt for a vacation  it fitted well and was flattering  totally a comfortable wear  however  after   wash on delicate   hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom  i am hoping i can return it  not worth the money 
too boxy i ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length  i don t know if the length stated is from a size m  but the small was definitely shorter  in the front at least    if you re petite with curves like me  it s not a flattering cut 
tie back tunic i usually love tops like this  i bought this is the store because if was so soft  got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in 
not impressed i m         #     d  this dress did nothing for me  the seem on the side with the knot doesn t look right  it s almost on the side but not really  there s a seem down the center of the butt from the waist  it looks weird from the back because it s such a fine striped print  not flattering at all  the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining  hit me just a bit lower than on the model 
shrunk! i loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress  it s loose and flows but doesn t look like a potato sack  i wore it once and got a ton of compliments  that said  i hand washed it  as the tag states  then let it line dry  and it shrunk to half its size  i re checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states  dry clean recommended   boo  so disappointed that i spend over      for a dress i wore once 
awkward sweater i wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed  first  the pink was way to sheer for my liking  the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area  then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect  a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit  the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks 
see through when i received this dress in the mail  i was thrilled  i loved the color and the style  although a bit too much material but comfortable  when i went to show my husband the dress  his first comment was very sexy  i can see your underwear and your skin    i don t understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress  when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it 
nan the print  colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely  the design is quirky to say the least  i ordered a small  as i usually do  i am      and weigh    lbs  this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket  it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist  it s not flattering at all 
nan buttons were broken off when i opened the package  stretchy at waist  not good quality for the price 
beautiful color, frumpy fit great color but frumpy fit  if you have any bust  it looks a bit like maternity
strange! i purchase this top of  what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic top  in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid section where there is at least   inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket  and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top     you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope
nan dress just did not fit will around the hips   also the string belt was defective   basically about to come off   looks like someone may have wore it and returned it   was not flattering at all 
off fit i actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt  even with the xs size  however  i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section  it s so tight  it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny  as the top part is still loose  i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem  maybe just not for girls with thighs     very strange fit 
tight armholes i loved this shirt and attempted to buy it   however the armhole is so small i couldn t barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me  i m usually a   and i tried on the   and    and both shirts had the same problem  it wasn t exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough  it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of  which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine  i d
huge and shapeless i have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love  everything about them  this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the     off dress sale   my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small  i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless  it looked horrible from every angle  front  back and sides  i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size   the fabric is nice  p
tight in the waist these were perfect in the legs  nice and stretchy  but problematic in the waist  i m generally a    size     but i had to squeeze to get them to close  they ve already gone back  if you have a tinier waist they d probably be fine 
cups size too big! loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge  i weight    lbs      and wear a   c  i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small  normally i wear a size medium  i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest  i m wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay  not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again  it s so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la
boxy moo moo disappointed     this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me  i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me  bummer  i liked the quality and weight  not too heavy nor too light  but shape is unflattering  it s going back 
design flawed i ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it  i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn t even see how it truly fit  i had high hopes for this dress 
sizing runs very large i am petite and ordered size small  and it came looking like gym sweat pants  the material was very nice  but in terms of the waist and length size  both run incredibly large  the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all  and hangs loose widely  will have to return this item  unfortunately 
nan i tried this dress on in an xs petite  the dress runs slightly bigger  it sort of looked like a tent on me  whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts  the other thing is that the dress just doesn t look like an almost      dress  the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too  it isn t sewn in though  and it was folding down under the arms  making it look like its ripping off  the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center  as if the material was too heavy to stand it s we
yuck i love jumpsuits   except for this one  the fabric is blah  it s between plastic and the material that they make flags out of  the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute  the tie thing that s just hanging there   it s a tie thing that just hangs there  it doesn t  look good hanging  and it doesn t look good tied   this jumpsuit had so much potential  i m definitely disappointed   for sizing reference  i am              c and a small was perfect 
disappointed i ordered this tee despite the price  the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor  nice concept for a tee  but failed in quality and value  it was returned 
runs large, not the most flattering fit i was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are    older and don t want to show off that much leg anymore  and    are  curvy on the bottom  and really cannot wear the shorter shorts  i ordered these immediately in the navy  i usually wear a    in pilcro jeans  and like the other reviewer observed as well  i was floating in these   not only in the waist but everywhere  the legs are big   but it s supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that  but they just are
man shorts i was so excited to try these  it s hard to find cute bermuda shorts  the legs were so wide  my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts  they don t look that wide in the picture  i am      and     lbs i bought my regular size    but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes  unrolled they came to my knee 
so baggy i grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size  because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress  and it left me puzzled   the print was pretty  but no amount of tailoring could save it for me   it was wearing me   maybe it could wear three of me   i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners  by making a garment without details  no installing more time consuming zippers  buttons or snaps  and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it
nan i would say the skirt runs two sizes too small  i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews  i purchased a large  i could barely get the skirt over my hips  even if it fit in the waist  it was much too short on me and i m       it s a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween 
nan yikes  there is a whole lot of skirt here  i am      weigh around     lb  and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing  depending on the designer  this skirt balloons out from the waist  on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist  i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking  the skirt is very long  hitting way below mid calf  there is also tons of material   creating a parachute effect  definitely returning 
wanted to like it so bad i love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their     off sale  i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn t even silk or a better material  but once i got this i was so disappointed  i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon tent on me  i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress  plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way  i don t even want t
not great on me i thought the dress was ok  but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress  i will send back  also a bit too high waisted for me  other than that  the dress is as it appears 
pretty doily at       i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off  the colors are so pretty for summer  but there is just too much fabric    i felt like i was wearing a giant doily  however  there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this 
really hoped this would be my go-to winter dress when i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much  i have been keeping my eye on it for some time  loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical  i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it              pros    the colors you see online are exactly the same in person    the jeweled neckline is lovely  it s one thing that drew me to it  this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
runs very small this is a very lovely looking sweater  unfortunately  it runs incredibly small  i m only      and the size small hit me above my mid rise jeans  it doesn t fit at all how it s shown on the model  it s also a very delicate fabric  seems like it would snag easily  i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it  but i m sending it back 
weird fit i loved the look of this blouse online  i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer  the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good  i am a   p and    b bra size  this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back  its as if the armholes were too far forward  it is fairly short but i am short waisted  i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it  if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
super cute but disappointing loved these when i tried them on they fit well and were so flattering  i am a size     and    tall and have a  bubble butt  and thicker thighs with a narrow waist i tried on a    they we a little tight on my bum and thighs but the waist was perfect  tried on a    and they were much more comfortable on my legs and worked on my waist as well  i thought all was good but after wearing them out for not even ten minutes they started slipping down constantly and loosed up around all areas especially my
nan beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on  as the other reviews state  it is short and wide  i like the top so much  i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape  otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box   
odd style i should have paid closer attention to the other reviews  i could barely get this blouse over my head  after getting it on  the armholes too are very small  the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie  i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck  i tried the small but think a medium wouldn t have been much better  it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves  i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair    if you have a tiny head and pencil a
sad top. i wanted to love this top  but  it looks like an ambitious    year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic  re  hopeful  but not good  the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on  sadly it is going back 
disappointed i found the fit of this dress odd  i typically wear a   or   in dresses  the   fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge  i am a   c so i need some type of support  i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price  i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store 
i wanted to love this dress ... but  it just doesn t measure up  first  the slip lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on   either stepping into it or pulling it over your head  and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky  unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately  the material is really cute  but the dress isn t worth the price   effort 
nan this top was just not flattering  i m      and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn t fall in the right places  made me look very round and i m not  so it s definitely going back 
misleading i sized down as other reviewers suggested  usually an    went down to    and the dress fit fine  but it was not attractive  the cut was like a tent with an empire waist  really just not attractive  maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in person  returned 
fit is unflattering i wish i had read more of the reviews    but thought i would give it a try  the shirt doesn t seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt  this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn t it makes you look very boxy  i don t know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made  wanted to love for fall     unfortunately  i am taking back 
wanted to love this but couldn't i saw this dress online and really wanted to love it    unfortunately it wasn t at all as expected in person   as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material  which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store  the neck was extremely tight  a problem i ve never encountered with any retailer dress  additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line  which protruded in an unflattering way  the pocket is not at all not
pretty print but didn't work. wanted to like this type  cute print  something about the width and length of this top didn t work on me  was a little boxy  i m         lbs  size xs s  might be cuter on different body type  i m hourglass and athletic 
pretty but flawed i was so excited to get this dress   i even paid expedited shipping  i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed  it was just too big  i m a size     petite and the size   was overwhelming  the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can t wear the dress  not sure what to do but buyers be careful  pretty color and design but not well designed 
heavy fabric i ordered this dress  expecting a cool lightweight summer dress  i believe it says cotton in the description however the material is a very heavy cotton linen blend would have much preferred a better quality fabric the color is a nice green and is well made it runs large  except in the bust which fit well 
almost so much right but then    too short 
disappointed i initially saw this top a few months ago  and fell in love  it ended up selling out in stores  so i ordered it online  where it was back ordered by a couple of months  i received it this past week  and was sadly disappointed  the design is pretty  but overall the quality is sorely lacking  i wonder if maybe the first batch was good  but when they realized they were so popular  and had more made  the newer batches weren t as good  not sure  the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery  and ther
this top is way to long. hate i have to return it   way too long almost more mid thigh almost dress length 
underwhelmed was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with  for the price of the dress  it felt very cheap  i didn t even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging  the colors were not as vibrant as the picture  as another reviewer mentioned  it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk  very disappointed and will be returning 
more blue than grey and way too big sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive  and then once they do  i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it  this is one of those times  and it was not my mistake  the shirt i received is not like this one  it is an xs  but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model  everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color  not grey at all  it is a pretty color  but not what i thought i was ordering  i hate it when this happens
grey not color as pictured on website i wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the  grey  that you order is much  much lighter grey  in addition  this shirt is super boxy    thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in  going back disappointed 
horribly scratchy and the bottom looks like a tutu  first  i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves  there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly  second  the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt  finally  the color on the  green one  is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint  back it goes 
not what i expected at all i probably should have gone with petite  this dress was just awful on  the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be  it hits me about thigh level  it s very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump  i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy  it s going back 
absolutely perfect if you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you  i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me  i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy 
nan i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it   i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it   the fabric is made of cheap poly that s shiny  thin  and clingy   it shows every lump and bump you have   the zipper at the back won t lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump   the sewing and hemline is uneven   there wasn t a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline
shapeless i really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality  but the shape is impossible to work with  it doesn t just run big  it just hangs there  really disappointing  it ll have to go back 
complete mess i love eva franco   this is a very poor version   bias seams are puckery    zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed 
sad :( i love this top so much online  i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed   there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online  also  this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest  it looks nice and drapey on the model  when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top  thanks to my   dds  looks more like a swing top  i m sure it s a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest 
cheap material -- poorly made do not buy this dress for full price  the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky ish polyester that you would find at a f   store  the stitching is horrific and created an uneven  hump  on the back seam  just absolutely poor poor quality 
humongous i found this as a return in the store  i tried the xxs  i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger  it was so huge  looked like i was wearing an xl 
so sorry i had to return i ordered in blue  so excited at arrival  it looked gorgeous   then i tried it on  i m        #    d and my upper arms are a little muscular  i normally order  p  sometimes  p    and never a problem  this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms   if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams  maybe i just received a product that was mis sized  or defective  all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you ll love it 
super unflattering i m            lbs    dd  normally a   p or   p in pants  i ordered an   and probably should have gone with a     it was super unflattering the print was overwhelming for my pale skin  it made my thin waist look larger than it really was  and rode up the inside of my thighs  i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that s     of the price and   x as flattering  if you have thick legs  this may not be the suit for you  i returned it  so fast 
white tent first off  this runs very large  i m normally an   and sized down to the   but probably could have done a    it looked like a tent on me  the top part is lovely  i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering  this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now 
nan i love the color and style of this dress  and i wanted to love it too  sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress  checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure 
lovely material, a miss otherwise i love the material on these shorts  unfortunately  that s all i love  the fit is awkward and i m an easy fit  they re boxy in the body   legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well  sadly  couldn t keep these just for the pretty fabric 
pilling after one day i love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment  if you have any thigh at all don t bother 
nan this one didn t work for me  ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein  riverdeck was cute and flattering cut  this one was boxy on me and didn t work  a bit too wide so sending back 
nan the skirt is comfortable and as pictured  it also ran tts  i m      tall and weigh     lbs  i had the medium and didn t need to size up to a large  when you put the skirt on a normal body  it looks like you are wearing an easter egg    and not in a good way 
huge jacket, wash color is not as pictured like one of the previous reviewers  when my jacket arrived  it was not in the great dark wash pictured online  it was in a basic  medium denim wash  i like the wash pictured online  i did not like the wash the jacket came in  additionally  know that it is just huge  i ordered my usual size  medium  and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy  but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was  i never tried an xs  but it was s
nan i got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it  the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise  i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture  love the fabric   soft and appears to be good quality  the length is perfect   hit right at my knees  size small   the flow of the dress is great as well  the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes  the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck   almost like it was on
beautiful print, bad design when i ordered this dress  i thought to myself  hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that s just the angle of the photo   flash forward to me trying it on in my home    yep  that s some side boob   it is very low cut under the arms  if you re super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene  also  i m a solid    in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case  the xl wouldn t even zip up  returning 
bummer! this dress makes me so sad   the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on  as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress  the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful   too big all around  too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut   basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes  it could have been so good  but alas  but t
runs huge,could work for someone taller? first of all  mine arrived in a regular denim shade  not the dark wash shown  also  the style is more like a blazer  and it was huge  i am      and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer  as well  the sleeves came barely past my wrists  they are designed to cuff as the model has done  perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic  the quality is excellent with some nice details  this might be one to try in person  if you can 
so disappointed i saw this online and went to the store to try it on  so glad i did  it did not work on me at all  it is so wide   just did not look right  it was also not flattering at the neckline either  i thought it was beautiful until i had it on  too bad   wanted to love it 
snag rag! the dress is beautiful in pictures  but all the reviews are dead on   it was full of snags when it arrived    snags to be exact  and the fabric was heavier than i expected  sadly  had to return 
the horror this vest looked so cute online but it s a disaster  the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn t work properly and it just hangs  itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie  seriously  it s bad 
too short i love the look and feel of the material  but it was way too short   i don t even have a long torso  sadly  it s going back to the store 
huge and shortedr than appears in picture this top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture  it also has a strong chemical smell  i ve had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out 
cropped i would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model  but it was a cropped length on me   
snaggariffic sadly  this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour  it snagged on everything    my watch  my purse  my necklace  i had to go home  change  and return the dress later  impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress 
wide wide wide too wide  the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape  you can t see your figure underneath at all  i don t like pieces like that  this went back 
love the style - hate the dye left on my skin i recommend this product  but with the following reservations      the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit  i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day  this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed  it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely 
nan this is a cute dress  but not for me     i think it runs very small     it is super textured so if you don t want to add bulk  aka pounds  to your frame  this probably isn t for you  it s too bad it s online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first  i m sure it s probably adorable on smaller  thinner people  unfortunately  mine is going back 
returning i thought that this dress would be perfect for my   th birthday  however i was disappointed when i received it  it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person  it did nothing for me  also  it runs small and was tight 
horrible fabric! the fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth  the cut of this vest is also bad  will be sent back 
love/hate i love this jump suit   sorta  looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin  i washed it and its still happening  when you put your hand in your pockets  they come out blue  knees are blue  thighs  etc  i looked dirty by the end of the day  wish i could return it  fit and look great    not great after wear 
nan i am normally a straightforward      since i saw the other review i ordered down to an     i am still swimming in it i would say i have about   inches of extra fabric in the waist hips  this is sized way too large  i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool   but i won t find out cause i m returning it on the bright side i might fit a   which would be pretty nice 
low quality denim! they ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase  i ve washed them once  and wear them a few times a week  so they re certainly not worn out  i ve never had a pair give out even close to this early  i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness  and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings  the color is lighter than pictured  i paid full price  the most i ve ever paid for jeans  because i d heard good things about jean shop quality  even at sale p
unflattering i purchased the blue with white dots  the shape was awful  but looked like a sack   returned
nan tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful  i couldn t get it off fast enough  picture this  tight in the best  tight in the hips  extra billowy in the middle  so confused and can t see how this would be flattering on anyone  unless you re planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric  skip 
terrible fit the quality of the fabric is good  but the fit is horrible  unflattering and strange  definitely a pass 
sadly, it did not fit me right i loved the design and material of the test  but unfortunately it just did not fit me right  it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for    also the pattern did not look good on me    unfortunately i had to return 
cute but itchy this is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty  unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second 
disappointed quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price  top is lined but skirt is not  material is tissue paper thin and see thru  there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up  however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives  was returned 
disappointed i m usually a maeve fan  i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly  it is also very thin material and showed everything 
disappointing for the price the cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible  i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust  after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length  so much that i can no longer even wear it  i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces  this didn t hold up to one wearing  let alone one season  i recommend strongly against it 
nan this dress comes with a built in fupa  literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering 
a sad disappointment the first time i wore it  felt wonderful  had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling  very disappointed with the price and quality  wish i could return for my money back  sad
not for me this is a beautiful dress  but the fit was strange  i have a small waist and larger hips  i generally wear a     in a fit   flare style  but styles like this i generally wear a     for my hips  even in a   this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half   i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips  it really is pretty 
going back... i purchased this dress in the green  and while the print and material were lovely  the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top  the billowly bottom made it look like a bag  i am  ft    d and     waist and the size   fit  which makes me think this runs large  i ll be returning this dress 
eek! do not buy  i used my     discount on this  what a waste  my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand  i should have gotten a small  i don t think that would ve helped  it was so awkward looking  nothing like the model  it made me look as if i had gained    pounds  it was waaay longer in the back like a mullet  the material was really thick  it is more appropriate for fall  i had high hopes for this to dress up or down  it was just so ridiculous 
just a blah top i ordered this since it looked so cute on the model   when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did   blah  the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top  plus it s lined   i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit  in the end  i decided that it wasn t worth it  too bad  as the concept was a good one  it just failed in the execution 
raglan sleeve style did not work with larger bust i saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful  i on the other hand looked awful  the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff  so the dress didn t move with me  it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out  then to contribute to the volume  the sleeve is not set in  it is a raglan style  that on me looked more like a bat suit  than what i was hoping for  a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair  also the belt didn t enhance the
love how it looks but doesn't hold up i love this shirt  love love love it  i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden  but i ve owned it for   months and there are already   holes in the shirt  and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines  the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart  the whole point is to be able to wear it  but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again    
nan mine came smelling like gasoline  not sure why  but i would have kept it otherwise  it s a smell that will be really hard to get out  looks like the picture 
poor quality fabric i purchased this top in the black and tan color  loved the fit  style and fabric  however  it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front  which could not be repaired  it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden  i was very disappointed in the quality of this top  i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once  i just didn t have the time to return it to the store 
too billowy i like the color blocking of this top  but it was too large and billowy on the bottom  it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape 
way too big on the bottom i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on  it is so big on the bottom  it looks like a tent  i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big  sad 
i really wanted to love this top! i read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big    i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent  with all of the extra material in the back  it billowed out in all the wrong places  the material is comfy and it s a very cute concept  just didn t work for me 
terrible fabric the good  the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute      now the bad  the material is wretched  it feels damp even when it s not    it s see through and unlined    it s scratchy and wrinkly    and though the cut of the dress would be fine  the fabric is so limp that the high low hem looks more like a tail      i wanted to like this  but charging nearly     dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable  i returned it as fast as i possibly c
sizing is off the bra is comfortable and the design is good  however  the sizing is way off  i am a   c and the small fits well with minimal support  not sure about quality  this one might have to go back   
way too long! this top was supposed to be        inches long in petite  it s actually        inches long   it s also large in width  hard to believe it s an extra small petite 
disappointed this dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away  i am a size   petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit  if anything i might have to size down  i purchased a   petite in this dress and i couldn t zip it all the way up  it was as if i was trying to get into a   petite   i don t even think a size   would fit  there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received  even if the fit was perfect i didn t
too flowy and too washed out this shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out  will definitely be returning 
fabric is very thin this is more of a sleep shirt  the fabric is too thin and see through  a camisole would not look good under it  will be returning it 
disappointing fabric the fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey   condensation drips from a glass  gel deodorant  etc  i tried the cream but it s very sheer  i had to return this dress   not practical 
loved but... horrible quality i loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn t wait to wear it  after one day of wear  i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem  this shirt was not tight on me at all  very disappointed 
all wrong i thought it would be heavier than it is  it s thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater  it contains wool so not really suitable for spring summer   it s also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider boxier too 
i was really disappointed i was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model  i ordered my usual size   but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable  i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn t as form fitting as i would have liked  i ended up returning this dress 
veille peasant top i was able to get this on sale  when it arrived  it was missing half of the rhinestones  i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way  it also was missing the little bag with extra stones  i m reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse  any help from anyone would be appreciated  i hate to part with this  but where was quality control 
nan i had hoped this blouse would be white   but it is cream in color  it was also more boxy than i thought it would be  i am usually a   or a   and went with the    a size   would be a better fit 
huge blouse i tried this blouse on in the store  i m generally an   or    in this brand  i got down to a size   and gave up  this blouse is huge all the way around  the detail on the blouse is pretty  but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it  i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond  perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself   i looked ridiculous 
boxy this top is too boxy and has too much going on  it should have no buttons or different ones 
ehh not a fan :/ my personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top  the material of the fabric doesn t seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me  i wanted to love this top but i did not 
too small! not as cute as photos  and too small in chest  i am            lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all  shoulders and sleeve length fit well  will return  not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days 
faulty zipper problem i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event   one    petite  one     the style  color and cut are all perfect  one not so minor downfall  however  the zippers on both dresses were faulty   they both broke in the same spot  both during the first time just trying them on  i can t get either of them to even budge now   will either need to take back or get fixed  very sad about this 
please stop going down in fabric quality i ve been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length  the fabric quality on these shorts  and many many other retailer items  has gone down  sure  they re great when you try them on in the store  soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on  i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a
beautiful, but.... this skirt is beautiful  fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it  there is a  life  in this skirt  it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way  or i better say  it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it  unfortunately  it stretched more than a full size  and generally lost its shape  now  the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore 
disappointed i had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email  and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself  i was very excited to get it  as it is a beautiful coat online  however  once i received it i was very disappointed  the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost       and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with  i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well      perso
literally unwearable. i purchased this in store in a vivid red color  but didn t try it on until i got home  big mistake  literally the first time i tried to zip the dress  the cheap  horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just   broke  midway up  right under the waist tie  i was trapped in the dress for a good    minutes and was scared i d have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it  eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape  can t wait to return this asap 
quality changed pilcro stet roll ups are my fave  i have about   or   pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on  wow has the quality changed  the denim is a lot lighter in material  now  the wash isn t as real  almost like i m wearing jegging shorts  these were my favorite but now i ll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore  why  pilcro   the sizing is about the same  they run a little large due to the
cheaply made the cut and color of the dress is awesome  however  the biggest flaw is the zipper  i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke  sad day especially at the price  there also were a number of loose threads  i recommend waiting until it goes on sale  you ll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper 
beautiful but odd sizing i agree with other reviewers  it is beautiful but too tight around the chest  i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest  i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable  sadly i had to return it  i am           lbs and a   c  by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual 
shorts aren't what they were shorts don t fit me like they did the first time and i ve only worn them twice  the material isn t what is use to be  it stretches out to fast  i don t think i will be buying these again  wish i could take them back 
horrible quality i love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great  this dress does not meet those standards  on the  nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke  i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress  i m dissapointed 
terrible zipper! this product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress  it s pretty bad when it won t even zip up on the hanger  such a beautiful dress  it broke my heart 
beautiful design, poor execution i knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen  but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first  thank goodness for that     at first glance  i knew i wouldn t be buying this  the construction leaves much to be desired  from the flimsy  single layer of unlined  unstructured fabric  to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt  i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim
hand wash? darling jacket coat  similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace up back that i bought a few years ago and still love  i was considering this one  but the description says to hand wash  seriously  a coat  that s simply not practical  not sure if i will buy this one 
huge this is a beautiful top but the xs was literally     inches too wide  very disappointing  i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me  i don t usually wear xxs  it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white 
must be tall & lean i wanted to love this coat so bad  the material is lovely and it s beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off  if you have any hips forget it  my hips are       you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy  the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders    like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird  but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn t a size thing  i bought a size medium  at      and     pounds 
poofy not good for heavy legs the color is as pictured  good quality  it s lined  the zipper in the back makes it look updated  i ordered my usual size  small petite size    it fit perfectly  i m   feet and     lbs  hourglass figure  i had high hopes  i have hips and short  heavy legs  the skirt only emphasized my flaws  if you ve got great legs you will do well with this  i do own other short skirts  but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal  if you re on the fence give it a try  it
neck the dress is pretty  i ordered a   and   not knowing how it ran  i took both back the neck is too tight 
nan the length of this dress is bizarre   i can t decide if it s supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all   i m not sure if i like it either way   also  at this price point  i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent   if you buy this dress  be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear   the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate  the one i pur
nice to look at top opens in the middle right in front  should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
great idea poorly executed i wanted to love this dress  but it has too many flaws  first  the  waistband  falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there  not a flattering silhouette   second  the fabric is a sickly yellow beige netting that looks like burlap  third  i can t imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it  on the plus side  the fabric isn t scratchy 
nan this dress is so short  i double checked to make sure i didn t get a petite by mistake   i m      and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck  it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front  seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short  the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn t work out 
high hopes are dashed! i wanted to love this top    looks so comfy and cute  but hangs like a bag  going back 
disappointing blouse this looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric  the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering 
huge, long and baggy this blouse is quite stiff  i wouldn t mind the boxiness if this blouse weren t so long  even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit 
what a mess! this top is crazy in the front and just way off when it comes to a cross over drape  the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to  bloop  open constantly  the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn t get to look good   i m busty  but this isn t the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me  the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it s not like it was too small and tugged  that s not the case  this blouse just didn t
this is huge! if you re pregnant  congratulations  this shirt is for you  if you ve ever dreamed of being an xxs  this shirt is also for you  i m a   d  normally a small or medium  but often size down to xs in swing tops  the xs is ginormous on me  although it fits through the shoulders  i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides  it s that wide  think flying squirrel  what doesn t show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve  which makes it look wide at the to
not flattering didn t like the dress  look pregnant in it  this dress is going back 
i don't understand this dress i have been continually disappointed in retailer s clothing for the past year  i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut  it does not make sense  since when did retailer exclusively market to older women  no  retailer s market has always been young adults  this dress is extremely matronly  although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt   is completely mismatched and gaudy  i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
had high hopes this dress was a disappointment  not black  but brown  and it was very oddly made  with a weird  seam right across the belly  on its way back   
cute but no this shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected  had to send it back 
so super small i can t believe how small this thing runs  beyond small  it s almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work  but there s no way it s going to when the l is actually a s  so sad to return this beauty 
nan was excited to try this interesting skirt  as a mega bailey    fan  however  this skirt didn t fit well  the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs size    my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i m not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren t flattering to the body  the  vegan  quilting isn t luxurious  i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn t lay to advantage when worn and i m an easy fit  length is so so 
wonky this skirt fits in a strange way  there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt   the elastic looks frumpy  unflattering 
center pleat off center i ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile  when it arrived the pleat in front  shown in the center  was far to the right so the overall look was crooked  not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that s the true design but it will have to go back  too bad because i had high hopes 
had potential, better suited for someone taller i was really excited about this skirt because i love the color  however when i tried it on  it was too much of a high low  i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person 
too boxy, pretty material i really wanted to like this top  in person though  the fit was too large and boxy  i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike  i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting  the material was nice and lightweight  perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust 
cheap this dress looks nothing like the photo  the sequins are dull  no sheen at all  the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap  shiny plastic  i didn t even try it on  because it was so hideous  when i pulled it out of the box  not remotely worth the price and wouldn t buy it on sale for     either  skip 
had high hopes but... gals  if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale  don t worry  it will   between the poor fit and the polyester  i have no good things to report about it  this is very much below retailer s usual quality and style 
wanted to love.. loved it online for its modern cut and print  however  when i received the item i was disappointed  i ordered my usual size   and i was swimming in it  i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way  however  this was not flattering  i would say i would have needed to size down to a   and perhaps it would work but i didn t want to take another chance  the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn t neccissarily expecting either  bummer that it didn t work out 
orange color was pretty, poor quality fabric i ordered a size    in the orange  it ran a size smaller than normal size    maeve tops  the quality of the material was terrible  it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath  that messes with the look of the lace on the top  the color of the orange was gorgeous 
nan i just got this and couldn t wait to wear it to work today  it is such a pretty designed top  unfortunately  it is falling apart as i write this review  one sleeve is unraveling  there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms  am so disappointed in the quality  i ll be sending it back when i get home 
great fabric, but runs small love the look of this and the fabric  but runs way small  i usually wear a    ordered the    then    just got the   and it s still too small  will be returning all   
beautiful color but strange texture i wanted to love this kimono   it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe  but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric   not a soft touch and because it runs small  i bought the m l and usually wear a       but i couldn t bring the kimono together in the front  for a belting option  
don't waste your money as other reviews have mentioned  this top has serious craftsman ship flaws  strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on  i wanted to love but sadly  returned asap 
wish i liked it i wanted to like this but it just didn t have much of a shape  not flattering at all  maybe if i was taller 
looks like shapeless lingerie this product was very disappointing  fabric was thin  it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top  so it s not flattering at all  at      it s really overpriced for what it is  it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape  what wouldn t    but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs  i m      and not well endowed  a b   so it did nothing for me    also  the online picture of the moss version looks like it s a grey black combo  it s not    it is really green
so bulky these fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky  no way 
nan i tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it    until i read dry clean only     really retailer  i know you can do better than that   
super short shorts... looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room  the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short  you can t tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg  the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you d most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer  i wish i could pull this off   maybe i m just too old for it 
odd fit i thought the photo of these pants was so cute  when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were  i held the waist up to my chest  just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground  i am not a short woman  i ordered a     i am        i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size 
so disappointed! the armholes on this dress are totally bizarre  i can t believe no one else has commented on them yet  i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses  i tend to be a small  size   in retailer  the armholes are so long that the dress doesn t lay right on top  i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me  we looked at all the others and they were the same  going up a size made it way worse  this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
a disappointment this dress looked gorgeous  light and lacy in the picture  but when it arrived  the  lace  that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive  the inner sheath was made of a heavy  sequined material  it was uncomfortable  scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail  it also added bulk to the dress  so that i looked ten pounds heavier  i can t imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip  the si
nan like other reviewers have said  this item runs extremely long and large  i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide  much wider than any standard wide leg pant i ve owned  sadly had to return 
there's something wrong with the arm hole there s something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut  i can t move my arms in this dress  otherwise the fit was fine  the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds  other than that the does nothing for your figure  i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im    lbs and       don t buy it  i know it s tempting with the sale price 
not what i expected i loved the look of this dress online  so i was excited to order it  but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be  i thought the material would be more lacy  but it seemed pretty cheap  there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory  but it made the material poof out just under the waist  making me look like i had a belly  no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat  returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead  which
meh i so wanted this skirt to work  love the design  but  it s way  way too long    i am          lb  and the small is   inch on the floor  i step on the skirt as i walk 
cute print but cut misses the mark i had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website  however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type  i am       size    hourglass athletic  the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape  would be cute on a girl with no hips booty but unflattering on hourglass figure 
great idea but the fabric doesn't work i waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away  i am disappointed    the lace fabric is very stiff  i should have listened to the previous reviewer  i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck  although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress 
nan while you can t count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off   instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue   the material has very little stretch and i couldn t get into the size   s   the   s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist   for reference i usually wear a size    in brands like   for all mankind and citizens of humanity 
very strange fit i m returning this cardigan  it doesn t fit me at all  it s shapeless and loose 
cute but disappointing beware  white is not white  white is more cream  off white  light beige  i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color  they are cute  but not white  i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer  but unfortunately  creamy colored shorts don t do much for navy white tops also  the button is very difficult to open close otherwise they are ok 
arms way too small.. i was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago  i got my usual size   and could not button it up for the life of me  i get it  i m busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky  however  the arms were impossibly tight  my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves 
nan this blouse is a disappointment   fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off  just odd  sleeves awkward   the back of the white shirt on the on line model is not the same as the white shirt i received  mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white  no ruffle  returned 
could have been perfect... i am          lbs  pear shaped  i ordered the s and it fit perfectly  just skimming the floor  the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet inspired colors  the waistband is elasticized but not elastic  and there is no unflattering poofing  which can happen with skirts like this  the flaw  however  is in the decision to only half line this skirt with an off white jersey material  the half lining isn t horrible but i found it
xl fits small, light blue is pretty i ordered the white and the light blue in size xl  both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses  everything the first reviewer wrote is true  the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain  like the blue   the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material  it s strange because it s not see through in the back but you need to wear a tank cami for the front  so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer      i would
wanted to love it purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail    i don t know why most designers overlook the back     huge disappointment   the back is totally plain  not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn t even the same material as the front  it s almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment  it was a very sad return  i usually love this brand  this was just a quality control oversight i guess 
nan very very boxy design cut  try on first or buy knowing you are     likely to return  beautiful skirt but if you don t have the right body type measurements  will not flatter you at all 
not what i expected ag jeans have been a main stay for me  they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body  however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked  the fabric and color is beautiful  i wear the same size for ag no matter the design  but this one ran too small  i have to return it  i will try the next size up if they still have them 
strange draping i m not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn t consider gravity but this is not what i expected  i really want to like this top  but i don t see how i can wear it 
ugh not sure who this is for but its not for me  skirt was long  stiff and puffy on my hips  i could not get it to lie correctly  maybe you have to be    to pull this off   
item is not as shown. very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain  not as displayed 
so very odd the fit on this is so strange  the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift  the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price  the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i m guessing  i m a   dd  size   in pants  and size     in dresses and i ordered a medium  i also have a long torso  which probably didn t help 
too short and too wide i #   m taller    #       so it #   s not uncommon for things to be too short on me  but this was really short for the style   it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size   both up top and in the wavy part below   the style really just did not work with the length   it looked very odd 
short and wide i was very disappointed by the fit of this top  it is quite short  especially in the back  and very wide  i did not find it flattering  on a positive note  the fabric is nice and thick   very warm layering piece for fall  for sizing reference  i m            lbs  and took my usual size xs 
too much piling loved the design but jacket looked like    years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store  i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it 
it's a no got this in the sky color  returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean  i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids  no can do  also  for the price  material just felt flimsy   cheap  it does run small   the medium was good on me and i m          #    b
looks cheap i didn t realize that the grey sleeves are attached  i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model   needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made  will be returning
nan i absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn t so odd  the sides of the skirt  wing out  for a very distracting and unflattering look  the stiff  felt like quality of the material only makes matters worse  in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate  it also runs large  i had to go down one full size 
nan i bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes  it runs big so size down at least     sizes  i didn t realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat  that part of the coat is really nice and comfy  unfortunately  the rest of the coat  the wool part  is very itchy  it would ve been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it s not   so i m taking them back 
missed the mark! very disappointed  runs small in chest and too long  the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail  i don t think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze  i have been in the fashion industry for over    years and this is a miss mark in my opinion  put it back on the rack  and save your   for something better at sweet retailer 
bhanuni is sloppy with its construction i had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago  but the problem i m having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one  they are all flawed in their construction  i had eventually tried   size   s in the coral because each one was flawed  on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all    the top design did not line up with the bottom design  this blue one is the same way  the top design does not line up with the bot
adorable and comfortable, poor fabric quality i tried this blouse on and loved the style  comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it  when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff  i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened  too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me      but  i also tried the blue and it gets   stars  as the fabric is much better  it too is adorable  soft and did not tear on gentle testing  the two blouse colors are made from different
nan this skirt has no closure along the slit  i can t begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo you would be completely exposed  it completely baffled me
lovely concept, lack of attention to detail lovely colors and print  my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side  it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely    and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top      for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed 
not the same jean as another reviewer wrote   this is not the same jean featured on the website  same cut and style but it s a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees  i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them  i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out     too bad they are cure 
bummed i was so excited to wear this shirt  even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot  and i found that the same thing happened to me  it also clings tightly to the body  i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders 
itchy! i have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful  in addition to it having no give  feeling like it will stretch out  and being slightly see through  it is super scratchy   it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric   awful 
not the right color i ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn t a glitch  the color is so off  the picture shows a dark blue denim  but they are not they are a light blue   with whiskering  retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading 
disappointing - shoulders don't stay down i love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top  unfortunately the folded top portion doesn t stay down at all  i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up  the material is also not the best 
unflattering fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell  not as cute as it looks in the photo  returned 
odd fit i really wanted to like this top  but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person  the yellow looks dirty in real life  not pretty like the picture  it is also a strange fit shape when it is on  i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all 
will not stay down i ordered a med petite  usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down  as a regular shirt it was not cute 
hidden tailoring faux pas the image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy     utility zipper hidden with   snaps  the zipper pull  when closed  sat right on my collarbone  which was he height of discomfort  it felt heavy and awkward  the dress was very high waisted for me  i m      and it was    inches above the navel   also to the point of discomfort   an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non petite sizing   the fabric is quite beautifu
high hopes that were dashed... i was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way  unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma s polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front   back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer  it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric      sadly  going back 
unflattering this dress was really odd  i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that s about it  the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large  i was just very underwhelmed with this dress  also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution  overall its okay just hated it on me 
silly short this top was very cute but super short  and i am a short waisted petitie person the waistline hits above your belly button  looks very silly 
cute design, impossible fit i tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine  but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy  with the straps tied tightly around my neck  it was like the cups just flipped out and open  i am a regular b cup  and i don t think it was sizing  though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes   the cup did not right and  for this reason  would make this absolutely impossible to wear  unfortunate  because the design is so pretty 
short mumu on me  thsi was ginormous  looked like a mu mu  it is pretty  but there was just too much fabric  even in the smallest size  the quality seems nice  and it looks pretty  but overwhelming  i will say  i think it would work on tail lean people  i have pretty muscular shoulders  so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look    pounds heavier  no joke  fabric is soft though  give it a try  just not for me       ref      lbs    dd       in waist 
so cute but design failure i am usually a size o and ordered and xs    due to the band in the center  not much give  it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part  that being said the cup design is a hot mess  i am a b c cup size and the top on this could not handle it  i felt fully exposed  i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage  the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small  i still felt to exposed  they are
bad cups! the cups on this suit are  ridiculous   unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend   the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor  seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front   i brought it back  sad because the design was adorable  just poor execution 
too small love the top  but very small to the size  ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x large 
this product is deceiving this product looks great on the model  but for anyone with a normal body type  the band in the center is way too tight  i m a   a and wear a    pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips  the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph  it is truly lavender and purple  i really wanted to love this swimsuit  but instead i had to return it  pay for return shipping  and i am out about     now  very disappointed 
unflattering even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy  disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality  i don t even know if going down a size would have helped  as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe 
eh. there s just nothing special about it  it runs small and the fabric is itchy  the design with button caught my eye  but i didn t like it well enough to keep it 
so sad! this year's pant is sooo much shorter! i ordered first the green  then the grey  in case the green was mismarked    so short    is this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trend    anyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them  but there is no way to lengthen them   i held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years  they are a full       inches shorter  wow   note how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the model s ankle  that s how they are in real life   i wear these pants in a tall  and live
more like a bathrobe big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat  there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy   just a bit of string  the color is great  but the quality leaves something to be desired 
nan unfortunately  does not look anything like in the picture  looks like an oversized house robe  i expected much more but was disappointed  i am definitely returning it 
seriously? i am a sucker for a peasant dress  i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous  i look like a schoolmarm  the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory  i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i m bummed that this wasn t what i expected  i knew it would have flow  but it s more billowy than i wanted  stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school 
ripped after one wear i have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events   this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality   however  the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding   the size   seemed to fit perfectly  but the fabric had no give   it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size   aa   for the price  i expected better   the color and style of the dress is gorgeous  so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer     
lumpy on the sides usually wear s and xs  tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up  if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight  the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low  it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way  two layers  green on outside  and a polyester beige layer underneath   but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket 
only looks good in photos dress was a disappoint  very thin and cheaply made  not worth the money at all  pictures make it look much better than in real life  top area is also made small so if you are busty  this is not the dress for you 
not sure i purchased this to wear on the same day  it did have a strong smell   i tried airing but didn t help much so didn t wear  tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing  by hand  my fault for not checking this part   it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i ll end up loving it 
petite frames will love this! the shirt is beautiful  but fits much too small  the stitching limits the space in your shoulders  and the hem too short  a petite frame would be able to pull this off  but i am a       medium  and the shirt didn t work in every direction 
nope i d been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away  well i was thoroughly disappointed  i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom  being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn t hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others  also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn t  the material is thin and and it definitely isn t high enoug
pretty, but extremely thin this item is pretty  the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery  but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents  my issue with it is it s very impractical  the fabric is extremely thin  and you wouldn t want to wear it in any weather below    degrees  it s ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall winter season  the tube top underneath doesn t work very hard to stay up  and isn t a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit  why wouldnt they just stitch a lining
nan very sheer inexpensive material  even on sale i m returning it
chemical smell this shirt smelled so bad when i received it  and i am not at all sensitive to smells   is it from the dye    i tried it on anyway  it is shapeless and nothing special  at almost    bucks it is so over priced 
dye stains everything! the turqoise color is pretty  however  it did smell bad out of the package  i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants  bra and cami  hope it all comes out in the wash  i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub 
unflattering fit this is a rare review for me  i usually love my retailer purchases  even at times when other reviewers aren t fans  but this top is terrible               b for reference  small frame  athletic  bought the xs in black  the length could have been longer  but i could have lived with the length  the arm hole area  however  a different story  because it s boxy  and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers  the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape  it did not fit snuggly
cute styling but... this shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging     the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much 
runs large...until you wash it i bought   shirts in gold  black and red  they arrived larger than expected  after the first wash and air dry they shrunk  i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide  also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash 
not worth the price fits large  wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price 
color transferred to my skin this is a cute top but i wore it for around   hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin  i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower   i guess it s going to have to wear off  thank goodness it was not a hot day   i hope that i can return it 
super huge top i have to return this top  the armholes are huge  the material is on the thin side and not what i expected  i can t size down  i got an xxs  maybe if i had been able to order a petite  it would have fit better  i ordered the red and i liked the color 
sad but true i too will be returning this sweater  love the style  shape and fabric  but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap 
sack dress unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of  i have sent it back for a refund    too big  too shapeless 
nan love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric  for the first few wearings  i was in love  then it began to pill horribly       would not recommend  my mother said   that s going to pill up   and i ignored her  and she was right 
not recommended for girls with curves the fabric is soooo thick  the pattern is very spring summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise  the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
pull over sweater looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me  just for comparison  and i wish all reviewers would include this  i am      and weigh     pounds  i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it  i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater  unfortunately i have returned it 
cute, but... wanted to love this dress  bit it wasn t to be  strange fit  and doesn t drape nicely  as in the photo  also  the blue color was much darker in person  wouldn t recommend 
nope i was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy   this dress had a lot of potential  i was drawn to the print   but the material is awful  so thin and scratchy  immediately went back 
no just a ginormous  shapeless shirt  runs extremely large  i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge  i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small 
not for the full figured this would be a great blouse for flat chested person  i am a size    and busty  i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through  you would need to wear a cami under it 
odd fit agree with previous reviewer  i am usually an xs p in this brand           lbs  but i could not get the internal slip over my head  the chest area was fitted  i am a   b  but then the skirt was very full and loose  i could have cut out the slip  but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price 
they look great but are poorly made i purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund  the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare  i am     and wear a size     they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order     first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within   washes i could actually see through the f
too small and too large at the same time quality piece except the fit is way off  i have a    c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom  i ordered the small  i frequently wear a small extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area  however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my   foot frame  i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom  wanted it to work  but didn t 
wanted to love i ve been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple   but sadly this was not it  quality isn t great which is surprise on a      price tag  top of dress is lined but cheaply so it s somewhat see through  the dress was returned 
not truly legging jeans i really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap  they were a little long and didn t quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine  i was told they wouldn t stretch out much  well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can t get them to shrink  wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean  too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans 
disappointing ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality  
nan i would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure  these pants seem to be cut straight up and down  the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model 
meh it just isn t that flattering on me  it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it s brand new  it fits fine  but doesn t do much to highlight my curves  it just kind of hangs there  the length is somewhat awkward  i bought the petite version   maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model  it s gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear  it does appear to be pretty well made  top part is lined  overall it s not terrible 
unimpressed this top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering  i would not recommend 
not as expected the material was thin  showed every lump you d rather hide and clung to the body  even the sleeves were tight  looked inexpensive 
clown jacket.    this looks so cute on the model  doesn t it  i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants  but it looks cute      that said  keep in mind the model is probably   feet    inches tall  i m   feet   inches tall  and this jacket came down to my knees  i m not kidding  the     length sleeves were at my wrist  so more like     sleeves      i m normally a size    in cartonnier jackets  but this only comes s  m or l  the medium is really a size     which was too tight across the shoulders and
length is far too short i ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length  another customer had a similar review  but i still took a chance that it would fit well  the sides of the shirt have slits  and because the shirt is too short  it shows the skin on my hips  the rest of the shirt fit fairly well  but i ll still need to return this top 
cute colors, cute tee i was really looking forward to these tees working  after reading the reviews  unfortunately  they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans  trying to keep it age appropriate 
sizing is off i have to agree that the fit is unfortunate  i am using a size   in retailer and most dresses  i knew to size up based on reviews here  i tried the size   and i could barely button the top  the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body  i sized up to a size   and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes  too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable 
pretty but sizing and cut is way off runs small  i m usually a size sm for retailer clothing  for reference  i m         lbs    b   the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist  i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size    the size    fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large  pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes 
unusually poor design by hd in paris normally  hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses  this dress is a big thumbs down  as most of these reviewer s and myself point out  the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don t just get a peak of your bra  you get to see the whole side of it  secondly  the bust of the dress would work only for an a cup bra  too small for the average woman  the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself   excelle
tight in bust, sheer, and babydoll look i pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here  big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty                  pros     great breathable fabric     cute look overall     sash in front brings it all together     buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch                 cons     runs very small in the bust  normally  i can wear a    or    with most of retailer s stuff  i tried on a    and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i
loved the color and fabric but fit was not great i really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn t lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures  when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store 
not what i had hoped for on a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer  however  this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape  very plain and unflattering  for reference i am        lbs   c    so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me  it had to go back 
not exactly as pictured i received this dress in the mail yesterday  right away  i noticed the coloring wasn t quite the same as it appears in the images online  in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted  i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on  i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses  it ran quite large and was way to long for me  i am          overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn t a hit for me 
beautiful design; but, disappointing quality it s a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue  however  the lace on the hemlines were snagged   the top was much shorter than i had anticipated   i m returning it to the store  unfortunately 
lovely...not on me i saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely  the perfect work dress  i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out  so i visited another retailer  and another to find it  unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me  it seemed to overly accentuate it  i am      a    dd size     the colors  the fabric are all wonderful  but this dress is not for me 
nan unless you have the body of the model   tall and very thin and wear a really small size   don t even think about getting this dress  it s literally a heavy sack  it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid calf in the back  the material is nice but it s an awful shape 
very unflattering! given that i am petite with thighs  take a size  p or   p  these were not for me  the run small  are really tight from the thigh up  run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin  on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient  i was looking for something i could wear to work  and these were not the right style for that  plus they seemed cheaply made  like they wouldn t stand the test of time  i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model  they would look good
more of an a-line than straight there were no reviews when i purchased this dress  from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress  i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn t straight  it is also pretty large  i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i m not sure i will keep it  still on the fence  dress is shorter than pictured as well  sleeves are shorter than shown  now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a
different than pictured i really wanted to like this top  just got it in mail today  but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i m   ft tall and the blouse was too short  i like the look and how it feels and i haven t completely decided whether to return it  but here are the issues i have encountered with this top  the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color  very soft too  unusual for rayon of this type  feels more like thin delicate cotton  i got my top in red  size
looks like maternity wear first  it s huge  i m not big busted but it s so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant  not exactly what i was going for  nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in  and i m short waisted so no tucking for me  back it went 
not that great this top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color  the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes  one side you could see the top of my bra  the other side was below the side of my bra  you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole  it was that big  this went back  will not re order  i usually order xs or xsp  this was an xsp 
terrible fit this blouse was so cute  i really wanted to love it  as others mentioned  there is something wrong with the fit  i m not a large person  but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small 
nan received this product with a gaping hole in it  very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
nan so unflattering  really disappointed  made me look   month pregnant and i m a petite size   
something's wrong i really loved this top  however  i couldn t get it on  i tried on a medium  my usual size   it s not that it was too small  something else is wrong with it  the large was way too big  too bad  i really wanted this look 
horrible fit this shirt looked cute until i tried it on    worst fit ever  im thin  and this style of top is usually quite flattering  but this one missed the mark big time 
nan this top was too big for me          lbs and ordered xxs  fit was fine and wanted it too work  but too overwhelming on me as well  will be going back 
nothing special i thought this would look great with skirts  but all my skirts are too dressy for this t shirt  that s really all it is    a nothing special t shirt  and it runs so big  i m usually a large or xl in tops  but for this one i bought a medium  and it s still too big  i think a small would have been fine  but  as i mentioned  it doesn t go with any of my skirts  so it s not worth looking for a small 
00 petite is way too short on the sides i ordered the black   white     petite  i m           lbs  and i order petite sizes all the time  the length for the size i ordered is about      on the back  from neckline  which is great for me  however  the length on the sides is way too short  the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only        so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans  not at all the way it shows on the model  i would order     regular length  but then the sleeves will b
odd fit i wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward  it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back  i am going to return this item 
cute shirt but runs large this shirt runs very large  i will be returning for a smaller size 
good quality - poor design quality jumpsuit but poor design  the green made me look a bit like  gumby the cartoon character 
way too big and bulky the quality of the garment is high  a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern  but the cut was totally off for me  i m usually an xs s  and was swimming in the xs  the arms in particular were huge and drapey  and the whole thing just hung on me  for reference  i m           lbs  
by the end of the day these jeans shimmy down =( bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day  i purchased them on the   th of feb and can t bare to wear them anymore 
hospital white lace on top of taupe sweatshirt the fit of the top is true to size  but i really don t like the taupe terrycloth like sweatshirt under the white lace  the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy  but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe  it is terrible paired together  i also didn t like the feel of the terrycloth like fabric against my skin  even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail  i m absolutely sending it back 
soooo cute, but short rise. i saw this at the store today  very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on  there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through  from what i could see on my body  it would have been too short in the crotch  i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely  i gave up  cute shade of green though 
nan oh dear  the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me  it made it look so cheap  i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip  instead  it s a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic  it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no go for me 
this top looks amazing on the model- not me i wanted to love this shirt  the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out  the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through   sadly i will be returning 
didn't work for me they look nice on the page  but they didn t work on my body  made me look big and boxy  maybe if you re super skinny  they ll be fine 
not great quality :( i loved these pants   super soft and cozy and perfect for winter  i ve worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have   holes  they don t say handwash and my washer dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes  maybe i just ended up with a bad pair  but i found the quality to be disappointing   
runs very small ordered the biggest size available  the large  the arms are so tight  i couldn t get it on  looked like it may have fit in the body so i don t understand why so constricting in the arms  i don t have big arms  either  fabric is thin but the color is pretty  can t recommend  i d pass on this one 
ugly design so i bought this  even after seeing the other reviews  because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different  this fits just as others describe  it was not flattering to me at all       had to go back 
overpriced, even on sale i purchased the blue s     lbs          b  and this was very large and boxy on me  not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price  the blue color is very pretty in person  darker and slightly marled  however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere  and very soft because of it   it is very thin  to the point that i consider this a  top  rather than a  sweater   the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined  i think that  even on sale  this is ov
give it a pass pretty shirt on the hanger  but there s a goof in the design  when i tried it on my  d self  there became this weird ruffle right beside below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo  now that i know it s there  the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept  but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it s not flattering  and i m just a    b 
costume material i ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey  but it s much more than drapey  and the front draping looks like halloween costume material   not chic or sophisticated  sadly  i will be returning this top 
poor quality dress is much different in person  thin ribbed cotton   a little tight for xl     it looks like a throw back dress from contempos   returned and would not recommend
good idea, poor execution this tunic is a perfect length for leggings  the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing  and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering  however  when i wore it a second time  i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve  one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder  since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes  it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl
looks great on the photo but was too big for me i wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite  the fabric was also on the cheap end
had high hopes & really wanted to love it, but... it just didn t work for me  i don t know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out  the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts  for reference  i am      and    lbs with             measurements and i purchased a medium  the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated  the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy  overall  very good quality and beautiful
lampshade if you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you  beyond unflattering  boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
hugs in the wrong places i was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable  however  while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist  i will acknowledge i m a runner with somewhat muscular legs  but was hopeful these pants wouldn t cling to them  for reference  i m     lbs and usually wear a size       in pants 
too fitted at bottom perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts  or the cut of this was not right for me  but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn t lay right on me  sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned  i am          lbs    c  curvy muscular frame and ordered a size small 
shorter than pictured, sheds a lot i ordered this in size xl  the ivory was as pictured  the lace details were well done  but  the length was much shorter than on the model  i m   ft        in  for reference  even the sleeves were on the short side  above my wrists  the main problem is how much it shed  just in trying it on  there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it  i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters  this one just didn t work out 
stuck! i was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect  when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top  convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it  the smell did not go away  i have washed it   times now and the smell will not disappear  i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it  the top looks and feels great   just the weird smell  now i am  stuck   
cropped and boxy it is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy 
stiff and itchy loved the look of this sweater online  was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was  i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over   it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price  knew it was definitely going back
slouchy soft tee with one problem.... i ordered these in both colors  the red is much deeper in person  more like a burgundy than pictured here  these tees are very slouchy  if you wanted a more fitted look  size down  these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans  the overall quality seems very good  although they are thinner than i thought they would be  they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos              overall these are very nice  but there is one is
not comfortable because of itchy tags   tags   one quite huge  about     by        very itchy  so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread   now even more itchy  i will have to wear these inside out 
itchy! i tried this on in the store and i couldn t keep it on my body for more then    seconds  it s extremely itchy  which is a pity  because i do appreciate the design    
a bit too swingy i wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i ve always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy  and i m not heavy   not great enough to keep in my opinion 
another synthetic fabric... so disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days  especially at this price point  the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars  or even half that  on a poly dress  please add more linen  cotton  and silk 
not impressed after reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale  i m tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures  firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together  if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it  this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines  i also found the blue  black
nan after reading the reviews  i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn t flattering on me    i m           pounds and generally wear a size small  but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me  it squeezed the bust a bit too much  and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering 
elysian maxi dress i was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress  it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering  i m sending it back 
huge - swallowed me whole i had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip   to look stylish and beat the heat  it is huge  the tunic swallowed my whole  it came down nearly to my knees  i m       and it was gigantic   shapeless and did not look stylish at all  on the model it looks like it hits mid thigh  i am a size      and the l was like a giant trash bag on me  if i had time  i would try the medium    
awkward fit beautiful dress  but has an unflattering fit  i purchased an xs and it s past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy  would be a perfect maternity dress though 
looked a bit like drapes beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined  sort of like heavy drapes  also  the length  as others mentioned  was too long  i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long  unfortunately  it has to go back 
too much fabric alas  i so wanted to love this  the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous    flowy  drapey  ultimate grecian goddess  but it just doesn t work unless you re super skinny  too much material  almost bulky  strange looking  the print is so beautiful    i love the pink floral  and i love the whole idea of the dress  but it just doesn t work  have to send it back       i m           pounds            and i ordered a     
didn't meet expectations this ran a bit small  i m normally a    this was a   and  just  fit  the pattern was very  digi   the length was shorter than i hoped  i m        and the fabric  while structured  was just cheap and acrylic feeling  pass 
huge!!!! this could seriously fit a large and it s an xs  so frustrating   this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous  i get the whole  loose fit  style  but seriously    you ve taken it to a whole new level  retailer    another trip to the store to return another item  a complete waste of my time  ugh 
didn't work this didn t work for me   the piece looked cheap  rode very high   needed to be longer   the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes   it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece   this went back 
super cute, really poor quality i really loved the way this shirt looked on me  it s forgiving and flattering  and really lightweight  the fabric  however  couldn t even withstand half a day s wear without snagging   times and developing a hole right in the center  i have no idea how this happened  as i wasn t wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it      such a shame  this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me 
not sure who this would flatter definitely agree with the other reviewers  this top looks great on the model  but pretty bad in real life  super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs  if you plan on ordering  i d recommend sizing down 
not as pictured i received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all  it is a great fabric just way too much of it  it is proportionally incorrect width wise  unfortunately this one will be going back 
disappointed i love tiny button down tops  this one didn t work at all for me  i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt  also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on 
big, baggy, boxy the fit of this top is nothing like in the photo  the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette  in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large  the embroidery  details  and soft material are great  but the fit is off entirely  this item is going back 
misleading the color is completely off  i loved the way this vest looks in the picture  i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment  it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture  very pale  horrible 
great concept, but fell short i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses  but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is  they weren t exaggerating     the small was way too big for me  and the xxs and xs are already sold out  beware that you will have to size down at least   sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured  it is going back for me 
don't bother this dress really was huge  and not at all flattering  i don t know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture  material was nice and soft  but i really don t see how anyone could look good in this  no matter what your body shape is 
short and shapeless even on my       short waisted      lb body  this was super short  it was also super boxy  not flattering at all  the blue was a good color but this is going back 
runs short i really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my       frame than it falls on the model  between my belly button and hip  and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot  i do have long monkey arms though  so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot   the quality of the knit seems nice  however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i
disappointed with fit this is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn t look anything like that in reality  it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over  i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive 
disappointed when i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments  it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning  after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable  i have to return it and am so disappointed  sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason 
pretty but tight in rear pretty fabric  nice style  took it back 
weird fit dress looks beautiful  but the fitting is very off  i ordered a size   which is the dress size i usually wear   i m     and    lbs   the chest area fits perfectly  but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose  i exchanged it for a    the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose  if i ordered the  p  i have a feeling it would be too tight  it feels like  it s meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen  also  this dress is very stiff  can t d
too sheer i loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it s extremely sheer  you can t wear a white bra with it  for example because it will show through  taking it back 
i really want to love these... i see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them  but these pants do run huge and they don t fit tailored like on the model  on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they re super wrinkly  you ll have to iron these after every wear and every wash  i m surprised to see the comment saying they re wrinkle resistant  they aren t  also  the kahki is more grey which i don t love  i got these on sale  but even at     i just can t justify keeping them  they re super comfy but
cute skirt, bad quality i ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it  so i returned it  when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better  i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well  both skirts also looked as if they had been worn  there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts  i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it s really bad quality 
not flattering if you have thighs! i am not particularly large but i have thighs  this pair of pants was totally unflattering  my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps  i now understand why it s on sale  you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged  but otherwise skip them  plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily  i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them 
i wish i wanted this romper so bad  after buying  and loving  a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year  i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier  i normally wear a size    or    and bought the large  it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs   retailer please stop with the capri lengths  it s tired    if you are narrow hipped you will fare much better  the fab
beautiful but.... i loved this skirt  so flattering and such a beautiful fabric  unfortunately after only   wears  the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me  literally   i bought the right size and it was not too tight  the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly  very disappointing 
not proportioned i ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug  you need a big chest and small legs and bottom  too bad  it s very cute 
wanted to love it but way too short!!! i was so excited to receive this top    the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short    i m      with an hourglass shape average build and it barely hit the top of my pants  it otherwise fit true to size  so disappointed     and for the price  it really should be cut better 
it is not white color, it looks beige indoors the tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes  to my surprise   the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area   the appliques laces on the front are made of low quality materials 
poor quality control i love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible  i ordered online and what i received is just a mess  the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread  not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps  a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside   the fit is just as big a mess  i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
nothing like other stevies i have other stevies  and these are nothing like them  the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny  the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx  two sizes too small compared with other stevies  additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves  see how it gapes in the cuff on the model  like  a rounded bottom  that is way more emphasized in real life  buyer beware 
le sac i have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn t too short  i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee  so i ordered this in the    regular  this dress was not what i expected  it is not flowy  but rather a heavy and stiff fabric  it is also way too wide  it looks like it can t decide whether to be a box or a bag  it is also shorter than advertised  last thing to disappoint was the color   darker and more muted than the photo on the website  i can t
narrow shoulders i totally agree with the last reviewer  i m          pounds with somewhat wide shoulders  the x small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn t move my arms  the small was better but was too big in the torso  the material itself was really nice  too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering 
incorrect sizing way too long   the sizing is incredibly off on this product  order a size or two down 
disappointed the top looks better on the model than in person  it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly  i don t like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn t look flattering or good  i am sending it back  looks very boxy 
gorgeous dress but ill fitting i bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer  it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large  i loved the feel  color  grey  and style of the dress  but i ended up returning it because of the fit  it also requires something under it since it is fairly see through 
this was used!!! got this in the blue and was so excited  while it looks cute  someone had clearly bought this  worn it  and returned it  it had human and dog hair all over it  not to mention some kind of red strings  it was pilling all over  so much for quality control    i don t mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount 
nan really wanted to love   but   the way it fit  lower part a tad too flowy   almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed  despite my bra size being a modest   b   the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare   such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn t work me 
a big disappointment this dress is super bulky and unflattering  the knit is loose and see through  looks like it was knitted by a five year old  if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you  back to the store it goes
maeve...has failed on this maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers  usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it s by maeve  go figure    this top is just atrocious though  does nothing for girls with a larger chest  very boxy and unflattering  gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute  however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on  not impressed 
i recommend with caveats i splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed  i m a   d  and the l was so tight i couldn t get it over my chest  also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped   and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it s matte  if it did fit like the model i would ve loved it  the print is beautiful though  bummer
this dress is awful!!!!!!! an awful dress  retailer why didn t you post my last review  i would not even give it a quarter of a star 
top part is gorgeous; bottom part is not my favorite colors are purple and green  so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves  i was was blown away  i was disappointed by the bottom of it  just huge  flowy  green fabric with no design on it whatsoever  i went with my first impression and bought it  but now that i m trying it on in the house  i m still bothered by the throw away bottom of this blouse  i m thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
disappointed i was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online  i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color  i am a size    and decided to order an l  the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge   like another reviewer said   like a maternity top  i would also concur with the reviewer who said    what  takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric   this is so true  the embroidery does not stand out   is not highlighted like in the photograph  they hav
nan these shorts just didn t work for me  i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don t have the curves for them  try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure 
shorts very nice fabric and quality but runs very large  i had to return my pair of a size    stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture 
fabric is pretty thin i purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet  the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin  she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back  i m not willing to wear a camisole under a t shirt  it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it s washed  so that remains to be seen 
do not wash! this simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear  but do not wash it  the hem completely fell apart for me 
not great for those with a little extra... i love everything by cloth   stone so was excited to see that they made a dress  hooray  i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts  when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips  i am a true size       and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move  my chest also caused the dreaded  button gape   it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure  so disappointing  
sloppy fit tried this dress in a small  i am          lbs    c  the small was huge   the sash helped some  but looked like a potato sack on me  also  i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store  i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store 
so close, but the cut is not good! i have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great  i m      c chest and athletic build   the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them  i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy  there was tons of room in the chest  but it was tight in the shoulders  i really wanted to love this  but there s just too many cut issues  it is a good length for work though 
save your money this dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer s aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk jacquard fabric to give it texture  which is how it looks from the photo  obviously it would have been more expensive  but in any case  this was just a really expensive polyester dress  which it says in the product description  but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt  thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product  it ll be retailer  but now i
not worth it. while i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired  the full price is absurd considering what you get   there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must   see attached photo   even in dim lighting you can see straight through    also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is  pull on styling   i would say that it is true to size  and i am usually a medium   retailer  but i have a sm
nan i loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile  however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams  unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn t hold  the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn t put it in the washing machine again  especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it s so old and barely agitates  would love this if it was made a little be
better on the hanger i wanted to love this product so badly  i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box  i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on  the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole tank top  this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person  large in arms  small on body  odd fit 
what went wrong? i am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards  this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago  poor quality in cut  fabric  design  this is a top one would grab at a local box store for        the colors are not as vibrant  the shoulders ill fitted  and the fabric and threads are very cheap  i was expecting so much more sorry retailer     my favorite store to shop 
meh? i bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back   the texture is nice but let s call them what they are  thin  leggings   not worth the price in my opinion   honestly  i can t seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i d spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans 
cute in pic but... like other reviewers have said  this is very sheer  look at the sleeve in the picture and you ll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well  the material posed challenges for it s creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other  tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren t careful  tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit  bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life  loose  billowy  and perhaps
not flattering i didn t think top was very flattering and  while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd  this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom   just looks mis sewn instead of purposeful  sadly this one is going back to the store 
a wrinkled mess i love anything orange  when i saw this coat online  i ordered it as i loved all the features  the features of the coat are fun  however the coat came all bunched up in the package  i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away  i tried the coat on   the buckles were poorly made  i ended up returning this jacket 
yuck there was nothing i liked about this coat  it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind  the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on  i usually like oranges too  but even this color turned me off 
super cute, poor quality i wore this for the first time today  and after just about an hour  it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack   its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable  very poor quality for the price   
so cute! but way too boxy i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online  i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered  it was comical  so so boxy  literally  shaped like a square  it must be pinned back on this model  maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked   or perhaps for a larger person  it may look super cute  just didn t work on my slim build    
sooo sheer the dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off  you can t see the ruffle  flounce that runs the bottom of the dress 
strange armhole construction this tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole  first of all  the armhole is way too low  second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm  since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem  no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side 
terrible i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever  but this dress is awful  i ordered the black and white  the fabric is very poor quality  the colors are washed out  i almost didn t try it on  but i did and found that  for me  the fit was terrible  though some of the reviewer pictures are cute  
too bulky i ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy  it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear  the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions  it wasn t as elegant as the model pic  is it ever   and for this price should fit like a glove  went back within seconds  also  it s pretty short  and bulky short isn t flattering on too many people 
not loving the extra stretchy fabric, part 2 long time ag jeans fan  lately though  i m finding the material is much too stretchy  i wanted a good pair of jeans  if i wanted pajama jeans  i would ve ordered them  i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered  same review there    so back both pairs went    it s a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted  if only they had been made out of actual jeans material 
not impressed i ve worn citizens for almost    years now  i keep going back because i have an athletic figure  my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist   and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation   these did not meet any of those standards  the ripped as soon as i put them on  the material seemed cheap 
lovely but the cut/sizing is not good this is a beautiful spring summer dress  and the quality of the materials is great  i wanted to love it  but the sizing is ridiculous  i m      and     and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs  while the pictures of the model in the dress don t suggest it has a shapeless cut  it definitely looked like a sack on me  a sack with a lovely print  but still an ill fitting sack 
beautiful fabric i ordered this in a      b     lbs         because it looked like it would run big  and it definitely does  the   fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about    lbs  heavier than i am  i am pear shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy  so i returned it  that said  the material is gorgeous   as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person  if i had a straight er  silhouette and a larger bust  this dress would have been a
sweater wrap midi skirt i m so upset that this didn t work out  i m petite at     and ordered this skirt in petite  however  i felt like it swallowed me up  the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire  i m the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing  but on me  i feel like a schoolmarm  sadly  this is going back 
gross! ugh  i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews  i tried small  medium and large on and huge huge huge  boxy  fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it s way too boxy  the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful  i would try this one on before purchasing 
frompy i so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings  i usually wear a   s and even the xs is was too pig  it drapes like a smock  the material is heavy  the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color     still looking for the perfect dress   
too wide i was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on  i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size   and a size    it was huge  it looked like i was wearing a potato sack    i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful  i am so disappointed 
nan this top is huge  i m typically a size   or    i bought the   and its huge  it s wider than it is long  even if i sized down to a   it would still be too much fabric  i m so disappointed  beautiful color and fabric but there s so much fabric  i love a flowy top but this one is way too much     i will be returning this top 
never been more disappointed... retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing  with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively  i suppose that i can t expect      perfection from retailer but     of the time that s what i get  this is that      this sweater is truly awful  i cannot  or find it very difficult at least  begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
fits like a tent so much extra fabric  not something i would recommend buying online 
too large and not flattering the top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me  maybe would ve been better for someone with a smaller bust  the quality of the fabric was just okay 
huge, even xxsp what a beautiful  comfortable material and the colors are stunning  i m so disappointed at the unflattering cut  it fits like a shapeless tent  even the arm holes have big gaps that aren t snug  i am         lbs  and ordered the xxs petite 
nan after reading the reviews i sized down to a    once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill fitting  it s like the designer didn t even use female measurements and used a box to make this top  too wide  i liked it so much that i sized way down to a   and it still fit horribly  it is too wide and not long enough  both are going back 
size down! whatever happened to sizing  pretty print and color but has enough fabric for   tops  it is also unlined which is not a huge issue  i wore it with a cami  the arms weren t too gaping for me  thankfully  i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides  i am     lbs and got the small  should have gone   or even   sizes smaller 
looked like a sack was very disappointed with this dress  it s very baggy  no shape  felt like an oversized sack  purchased in med  bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped   
poor quality i bought this t shirt in pink  blue  red  grey and black over the past year  every one of them except the grey  has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline  i ve returned them all  the fabric is thin and the quality of the t shirt is terrible 
nan love this top  but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me  hoping there s a sz sm in stock 
i had such high hopes i had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews  first off it runs really small  i usually wear a small or medium     or    i couldn t even get the   on  i probably could have even done a     the fabric was extremely flimsy  i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off  other than the sizing and the fabric  it just wasn t flattering on me 
looks good online loved this online  but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky 
not as listed does not say ribbed  did not want ribbed  would not have bought ribbed
skip it this skirt looks and feels cheap  and the color is much more green than pictured  additionally  i comfortably wore a size   and then lost a few pounds  and this is still way too tight to be flattering 
super itchy! super itchy  had to return 
way too small this is a beautiful skirt  but runs very small  i usually wear a size   and could not get the side zipper closed    at all 
too small i usually wear a   and ordered two other skirts at the same time  the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size    very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it 
poor quality this top is beautiful in design  but sadly  i will be returning  it is hand wash  and even after doing so  i had   unraveled threads resulting in large holes  unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing 
smells awful i bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings  i thought the price was great  too good to be true  you get what you pay for  once i opened the box they smelled awful  it was a chemical smell  i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better  i have washed the gray   times and it still smells 
not for my hips i m     at        pear shape  the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn t lay flat  loose on leg opening   which i liked  but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider  i got a medium
odd fit i couldn t even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd  the arms cut off short and the seams don t hit your shoulders where they should  all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering  moving around in it was not easy  i will return this one 
nan the top red is more like orange  was disappointed and returned it
very low cut...and a weird snap love tiny  i am               lbs depending on the day  and a   a  i also have a very long torso  and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me  this one  however  was a huge miss  i ordered online in my usual tiny xs  it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated  so it looked boxy on me  however  the worst part was the placket  the description doesn t note that it s held together with a tiny snap  that snap takes nothing to undo  and then
nan loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown   however this is a thin cashmere for the price   returned 
wish it was as pictured it looks adorable in the picture    but just not flattering in real life  too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way  makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves  it s a pass  love the blue print  though 
hole in it after a month i have had this shirt for a little over a month  i ve wore it maybe     times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder  it s not even on a seam  so i can t fix it  i expect much better quality from retailer  don t buy this  the quality is very disappointing  which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts 
missed the mark oh boy   i didn t get this one  and it runs small  too bad 
scratchy i love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss   it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first     hour of wering it  also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it  it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill  i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back 
nan this blouse is stunning on the website  however  it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo  i was very disappointed and will be returning 
too much fabric, makes you look larger i loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed  the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured  there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large  i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail  sadly  it will have to go back  it may look good on a very thin frame but didn t complement my average one 
quality is just not there... i had such high hopes for this blouse  as it looks totally stunning online  however  it s not as pictured described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat  but rather hd in paris  for the price  the quality is just not there   i ve seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less  i returned it without a second thought 
this dress is all polyester! beware! i got fooled by this dress s description  it s      polyester and not wool as it claims to be  looks cheap returned it 
petites beware i m         which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer  former employee  and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long  not even with heels is this gonna be right  and no discount towards hemming  i ll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it s way too long 
long in front {short in back} it s the inverted invert     not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore 
too small thought this would be great for a laid back wedding in new mexico  but didn t fit  i am a       and the    barely fit my chest and arms  not flattering  material did not seem very breakthable  had to return  better luck next time 
nan looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person  runs very small  i returned it 
didn't work for me i was excited to get this romper  but it just didn t work  i m petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me  returned 
good for one use after washing this top pilled terribly  it is beautiful  but only for one use 
bigger than my first apartment i followed the other reviews and sized down  normally  i m a small medium in retailer           for clarification  and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy  i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn t have to pay rent on the romper  given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it  oddly  the arm holes were normal sized  i returned this mess 
nan this dress was very boxy and unflattering  i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back 
nan i agree with the other review  the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made  the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality however  the shirt is very wide  i am a          and the small is way too big  the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance 
i returned this. i agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape  it doesn t look at all like it does on the model  i returned it 
poor quality and unflattering this top is has an awkward neckline  doesn t lay like the photo  as mentioned by another reviewer   see threw  and of poor quality  the fit is very baggy and unflattering  and material is very thin  it also runs very large   the color is pretty  but that is it   
boxy hi  when i received this top i tried it on  looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return  the quality is excellent but it just too boxy  fits nothing like it appears on the model 
poor cut & quality i really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide  short  and crooked  after it was washed once  it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong 
wanted to love i wanted to love this shirt  but was very disappointed  i had read other reviews and still ordered  but wish i would have listened  the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering  had to send it back 
terrible but had so much potential when i saw this online i immediately put it on my  must buy  list  i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store  in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon  luckily  my b m store had it and i am so glad i didn t waste my money or time ordering it online  this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark  what the product shot online doesn t show is that it has dol
cute top but looks like a tent (i'm not kidding) i love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee  in two colors no less   i was very thrilled especially since it was during the     mother s day promotion on all items  based on the model s photos  the top looks flattering with a swing type style  i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top  when the package was delivered  i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant  the tops are so wide not like the webs
not my favorite purchase i love the design of this top  however  it s quality is lackluster  the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering  at least on me  if it had a few more inches  also it s pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma  i will still wear it because i love it  looks great with a denim vest over it 
thin, boxy i bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews  it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts   like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly   it didn #   t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug 
huge i love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version  but it was huge and shapeless   nice material and fabric but this one is going back 
nan so thin and see thru it s not even wearable in public  extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price  i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out  going back 
huge! hi  i would have to agree with all of the reviewers i unfortunately had to find out for myself  mistake  it s huge  i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn t help 
fragile fabric i love the look of this sweater  but just bought and put on at home and noticed   pea sized holes in fabric  near arm holes  but not on seams  not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate  will try to repair but scated this will not hold up    look it over carefully before you buy  they kind of look like moth holes   
tent-like but soft & comfortable i bought this in size xl  it is so much bigger than i expected  there are panels of material  it really is huge  not flattering at all  still  i kept it  the material is so soft   flowy  i ve gotten good use wearing it around the house  doing chores  resting  etc  i wouldn t wear it out doing errands  but  around home  it s perfect for feeling cozy  such a strange cut  i don t know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy  i think many would enjoy wearing it at home 
too large and low quality i wanted to like this coat so bad  i loved the bright red color and design  but when i received it  it seemed very cheap and just too large  i returned it 
unlined and unshapely i have been looking for a fall spring coat to wear when the weather is between    and    degrees  this  coat  looks great in the pictures  but so disappointing in reality  the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft  it is unlined  so i m not sure why you d even wear it    if the weather s warm enough to wear a thin  unlined jacket  why not just wear a sweater  the weight is not what i would expect at this price point  even worse  the design is terrible  my husband  who has a great eye 
terrible visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat  and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed  i d already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized  i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy  especially around the collar  there is nothing crisp about it  i ve had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this  if i wanted fleece i wouldn t have picked retailer as the s
cute but... i loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam  on mine  was crooked  no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it  sigh  i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however 
what a mess i had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist  i can see why someone returned it  the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top  from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it  probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer 
too transparent i ordered these in m           lbs   and they are tts  they fit well and are neither tight nor loose  the issue that i have with them  and the reason that i sent them back  is that the material  although comfortable  is completely transparent  if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these  the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless  furthermore  these are not white but off white  and quite a yellowy off white  at that   so these loungers don t look as cute with the feature
short in the stride super soft fabric  however very short in the stride  i ordered an xl  normally wear         i had to return it 
fits like a giant tent the photo misrepresents how large this sweater is  it is giant  petite ladies stay away from this sweater  i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me  the neckline wouldn t even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose  also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model  it is like a tent  i m so bummed  the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft  it s too bad it doesn t fit smaller women 
this dress is huge i saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery   i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals  i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy  unfortunately this dress is huge  it is a rectangle with pockets  i bought the xxsp  my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me this dress was beyond alterations  too bad it was a great idea but no
weird fit this top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types  i am     and     and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips   will be returning 
stretches out, washes poorly. wish i could return. so disappointed  bought these in a    and should ve gone with a     they re super cute   i got the green  the fit is off  like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much  i would return these but have already washed them  they wash terribly  too  there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states  so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these  i ve been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i ve been severely
cool design, extremely tight fit the design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect  however  the fabric  despite    spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down  the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch  while i was able to pull them on  size    for     lb        i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably  with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation   please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer 
so wanted to love this but... i was expecting elbow to full length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short  very weird look for a wrap  returned 
where are the sleeves? i was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves  from the photo  it looked like full length sleeves  it went back 
fits amazing...formed holes after 1 month really disappointing quality  these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month  i love pilcros  and am totally shocked at the poor quality   retailer  i hope this is just a fluke  not worth the money 
quality look, sizing off. this dress either runs large or just has too much fabric  ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me  embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown  if the smaller size in petite was available  i d have exchanged it  but it is going back 
shapeless tent i tried this on in the store and it was huge  i couldn t try on a smaller size because they only had a   and    i tried on my usual size     i don t think the embroidery is as pretty in person either  definitely not worth the price 
nan this is the oddest fitting pullover  there is too much fabric around the chest  it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front  i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness  is that a word    i gave it away  
bizarre seams at waist i liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine  but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering  they are scalloped at the hips  so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all 
size up i bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small  can t review anything else because i couldn t even get them on     ridiculous
huge i am         lbs  got xs  it was huge on me  had to return it  very trendy  great quality  unfortunate design  not worth the money 
ripped as i put them on these are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter  but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom  obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight  but these fit perfectly  even on the looser side  and ripped effortlessly  pretty embarrassing given the price  bringing these back      for reference   if you decide to try your luck   i am          # and my normal size s was perfect 
so much potential... this coat is beautiful in color and design  we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it  i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been   months pregnant and still would have had room to spare  i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range 
disappointed i ordered this in both an extra small and a small    i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes  the extra small was true to size and had a great width  but was shorter in length than i would ve liked  if it shrunk at all  it would ve been unwearable   the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked  but i decided to keep that one      the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it  however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i
beautiful but not practical a beautiful shawl but not practical  i was impressed with how elegant romantic it first felt looked   however  after   minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders  the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem  lovely for the first   minutes of wear and then awkwardly annoyingly wouldn t stay on my shoulders  the neckline is undefined and it just fell off  not a great design  disappointedly returned it 
ripped before i could even wear it in a sea of dresses  this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store  i am a pear shape  and ended up trying both the medium and the large  taking the medium home  it was super flattering on  and was an appropriate length to pair with tights   here s where the problem happened  i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving  i put it on  and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist   riiiiiiiiiip  the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband  so disappointed 
very thin material i was so excited to try this on in the store  because i ve had my eye on it online  unfortunately  it is not like the picture  the material is very thin  almost translucent  i also could not figure out how it get it on  the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front  love the look of black design on white  hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i ll skip this one 
fleeced tula hoodie i m upset  i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper  the picture of the grey does not have a zipper  i prefer no zipper  so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper  i was disappointed  it s going back  why have a model where an item that you re not offering   
this is a zippered hoodie just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper  it s very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer s picture doesn t match the actual product  it does fit true to size however 
nan i loved the style so i ordered on line  it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear  i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit  i am returning this item  
cuter online i wanted to love this dress   and did from the picture online  when it arrived  the black already looked faded and old  also  the embroidery looks like a grandma  but not in a cute vintage way  the fabric is stiff  which causes a boxy  unflattering look  had to return it 
disappointed i also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images  it is very thin as others have said  the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs  structured  it is more similar to a cape or shawl design  if you  re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it  i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design 
strange fit the pattern and fabric are lovely  but the sleeves are short  unlike the photo  so it drapes very strangely  i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo  had to return this one 
i wish it looked like it did on the model to be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
complete color shocker! i ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black  they were not   they were wine colored  i liked the color  but not in combination with the other colors in the dress  black would have been a better look  i had to take it back  sad   
more wrong than right... i ordered this after reading through the reviews  i realize the reviews were mixed  but thought i d take a chance  unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress  right  i loved the various colors  yes  it shows black but is actually brown   i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi attached to the dress  with the same hi to low hemline  wrong  as said by others  the sleeves were very tight  the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model  it isn t real
overpriced potato sack after readying the reviews of this dress  i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner  boy  was i wrong  first  this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on  i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o  one size fits all  sizing  it did not embrace my curves at all  the material was not as chic as i would have thought  overall  the entire dress was not flattering  honestly  i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it 
ugly! too much material everywhere  i am    lbs      and i ordered an xs as usual  i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors  nice green slip  though  i will return it asap  this is super ugly 
unless you are twiggy, this is shape less this dress hangs horribly  unlike the photo  the waist does not cinch  too bad  the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice  because i bought it on sale  i may try to tailor it to work  but unless you are willing to do that  its a no go     
nan i am returning the dress  it has too much volume and is not flattering at all
not good for sensitive skin i saw online  great quality sweater dress  reviews about seemingly extra fabric  easy fix with a seamstress  i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters  wool  angora  mohair       xsp  tts  length arms  but lots of extra fabric for width  just trying it on was too itchy for me 
sent it back this runs super big and it just wasn t flattering  way too much fabric  i wanted to love this dress 
large and wide this colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all  it had to go back 
so unflattering i bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple   it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever  i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well  i ordered the xs in blue  it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering  i am      and      i love swing dresses i just don t think is cut well 
swimming in fabric this looked fabulous on the model  of course  and i love sweater dresses  but even in an xs  i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous  concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere  a definite return 
how many stylists did it take...     for the model to look like this  pros  nice quality  the colors of the blue version  at least  are rich and beautiful  note that the dark color pictured is really brown  not black  the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture  it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall winter  it is layered over a bright navy poly slip  cons  i am        #   i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med  the sleeves were more dolman than fitted  i imagin
too much material i wish this dress was more fitted   the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture  i bought this dress in an xs  but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress  it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears  i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress  sad to say that it is going back 
wanted to love... really wanted to love  the top was very flattering and loved the material  very swingy and forgiving  but way to much material  i was drowning in it  sized down to x small but no go 
beautifully colored potato sack i m          and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie  i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you re     and above  it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt  a belt was no match for that much fabric  the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful 
nan i disagree with other reviewers on this  it looks a lot better in picture on the model  i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way  fabric feels great  i want to love it but it is going back 
love but also very annoying i love this tank  it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws  it rolls up every time i walk or do anything  it becomes very bothersome 
wanted to love this terrible fit for a longer torso   runs small in hip and lining  huge in the waist   not good for an hourglass figure 
nan this sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at      
drab color, weird fit couldn t make it work  even belted  ivory color is darker irl  dingy light tan  like dirty vintage   drop  waist is not dropped at all  just a maternity ish cut that starts boxy loose high up  below bust   then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level  not low hip  into the skirt  i usually find a line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy  curvy waist  but this does not  adds ten pounds  poly fabric heavy hot  rayon lining awkward and doesn t flow drape            lb   a  tried xs 
awkward shape, cute fabric i m      about    lbs and ordered a size    the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all  i probably would wear a   instead of the    but could tell that even if i had the    the cut of it still wouldn t be flattering on me at all  it was baggy in odd places and had no shape  the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice  with a fitted slip design 
looooong.    i m      tall with a short waist and long legs  and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles  i would have kept it if it had stopped mid calf like in the photo      i m          and the size    fit me perfectly in the waist hip area  so i would say it runs true to size      the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy  so that s a plus  at least you don t have to undo them to go to the bathroom 
sweater is huge!! had to return  ordered an xs which usually fits perfect    b chest and it was falling off  shoulders and chest   it was like a sleeping bag  huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater 
cute but too short the model looks like she s    years old   this sweater of course would fit a younger teen  it definitely won t work for a grown woman  please make some longer sweaters 
made me look larger than i am this sweater did not flatter a sz    with   d chest  it s very well made but not for the curvy girl  this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others  reviews before i purchase 
another example of retailer quality going downhill.. these pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible  i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either  but i thought i d give it another shot  never again  i m on my  th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely   i mean huge holes in the fabric where it s just disintegrated  even at extra   off the sale price it s not worth it  the full price
no bummer  i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen  seriously looks maternity to me  the neck is also too wide  the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn t work on me  i returned this one 
large and boxy good reason to read reviews  i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy  heavy fabric makes matters worse 
poor quality this is another item i ve been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available  i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn t even try it on because i knew it would be going back  the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric  the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim  so much potential just executed poorly 
only the sleeves are pretty; the rest is terrible the sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store  they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large  well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top  the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas  in fact  that s what it felt like to wear it    like i was wearing a tent or an artist s canvas on my chest  yuck  how can this designer put so much thought and care into t
tight and cheap looking i went with my usual size  but it is too tight  it fits  but i would feel uncomfortable in it  i ordered the pink one  which looks nice in the picture  but in person  it looks cheap  the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the     s  that beaded neckline added to the cheap look  this one is not for me 
pretty, but going back i just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big   i wear an   in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine   this one does not even zip up  i might exchange for bigger size  as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent   or it may just go back 
nan i can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone  i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste  i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake 
nan i bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge  at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case  the fit is definitely  sack like  as other reviewers mentioned  i had to return 
misrepresented in picture dress appears to be slim fit  but that s far from the case  usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my       but it just hung on me like a heavy sack  i have a hard time finding dresses now that i m not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions  weddings  memorials  special occasions  i hoped this one would meet my needs  disappointed 
beautiful knit dress - runs way large! i ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me  i m usually fine with the petite sizing  but this didn t work and i m so bummed  the dress is soft  the blue color is gorgeous  but it fits like a bag  i wanted to love this  but sadly will have to return  i think someone with curves will love this dress  it is really beautiful quality  just does not fit a petite frame 
very disappointed i loved these pants and purchased them in three colors  like another reviewer  within a few weeks  having worn them no more than a couple of times  the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes  i was not hard on the pants   just wore them to the office   and line dried them  so disappointing  as i really did love the pants  total waste of money 
disappointed i had high hopes ordering this top   unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description  it also felt rather cheap   scratchy  poor quality for the price 
buttons at top break too easily let me start off by saying that i really  really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts  got a  p   unfortunately  it didn t work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily  i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didn t even bother trying it on  the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop
not the same dress after reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model  the dress they sent me is not this dress  it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter  like a cross  there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer  it was scoop and if you pulled it down  the neck went up  the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here  is rava  the length measured at     not the st
